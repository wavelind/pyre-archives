[h1]Summary[sup]1[/sup][/h1]
[p]
Born of the sky, of the mountains, the SkyWings are a strong flight-based tribe. They rely on their large wingspans to dominate the skies using superior flying ability and their hotter than average breath to singe any dragon that dare attempt to challenge them. Their bodies are lean and slick, meant to cut through the air with unparalleled efficiency and adapt to the turbulent 'highest sea' of the clouds and wind. A dragon would find it difficult to keep up with even the sickliest of SkyWings in a fly-race. Most SkyWings of pure blood are of red and orange hues, alluding to their hot flames and temper. Furthermore, while also being rulers of the skies, they are too the tallest dragons on the planet, standing at around seven meters, dwarfing that of HiveWings or SeaWings. However, with such height and wingspan comes a lot of weight, being the second heaviest tribe known to Panthia. Such power comes with drawbacks, leading to harmful physiological damage, if rarely, to some of their hatchlings, with some SkyWings being hatched with too much fire to none at all, leading to hardships and stigma.

[h3]Height[/h3]
[p]SkyWings are the largest and tallest dragons on the planet of @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f). A healthy SkyWing dragoness oftentimes stands proudly at seven and a half meters at her shoulders. Her brother, should he also be a healthy SkyWing, will stand at about seven meters tall at his. Both dragons will likely have a wingspan of about seventeen meters, making it the greatest of any other Panthian.
 [/p]

[h3]Weight[/h3]
[p]
Members of the tribe are also quite heavy, second only to the rugged and durable @[MudWings](species:387caa71-4e59-47c6-857f-06bd88c247a0). A SkyWing's weight is due mostly to their stature as well as the excellent physique needed to power it. The average dragoness will weigh about three and a half tonnes, or three thousand five hundred kilograms. The average dragon will weigh a little bit less. Oftentimes only three and a quarter tonnes, or three thousand two hundred fifty kilograms. 
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Speed[/h3]
[p]
As expected with their great wings and comparatively lightweight builds, SkyWings are the fastest flyers on both @[Pyrrhia](location:5f158d52-c163-4041-94a9-a4162f55853b) and @[Pantala](location:326aae77-9f26-4124-91ea-e31a4e23a695). The average dragoness will have a cruising flight speed of roughly eighty knots. The fastest flight speed ever achieved by a female SkyWing is a flat one hundred knots. A typical male SkyWing will have a cruising flight speed of eighty-five knots. The maximum recorded flight speed for a male is one hundred ten knots. Both sexes outperform the four tribes in second place, being twenty knots faster than the @[NightWings](species:353bedde-8ebe-4b9f-a934-1bfd2c129bc9), @[IceWings](species:3c9c3d1f-b523-4ad1-9fb3-da3d914510cb), @[SandWings](species:04e1f884-1838-432c-8ea6-e76277b0979f), and @[LeafWings](species:26cdc2ff-4485-4c5f-b969-baaa63958009).
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Form[/h2]
[p]
SkyWings are highly streamlined in their body shape and virtually all members possess an inordinate amount of raw strength. This strength manifests quite a great deal in the shoulder and chest muscles in order to power their massive wings. However, it would be a great disservice to the tribe not to ensure that proper credit is given to the other aspects of their bodies that are just as strong. Both sexes share a similar overall shape and form, with no true significance being noted in the course of research for this scroll. Further descriptions represent only the general population of available SkyWings, and not all SkyWings are hatched the same.[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Head[/h3]
[p]
The average SkyWing will have an angular head with a sharp keratinous "beak" at the end of a long, thin snout. Their two nostrils face forward and are set at the forefront of their face. On top of their snout is a small horn that sits directly preceding the beak. Travelling back from the horn and towards the forehead will lead to the thick ridge of [tooltip: A type of scale known for its armor-like qualities and comparatively large surface area.]platescales[/tooltip] directly above either eye socket, forming the eyebrow. Continuing past this point to the back of the head will lead to the set of two horns that protrude from the skull in a twisting fashion inward. These horns are parallel to the rest of the head and sit just above the ears on either side of the head. The ears are thin at their base but widen and become concave with length. They can be angled and flattened against the head and neck in such a way as to prevent damage and even major loss of hearing during flight. Lastly, their neck is of medium thickness and serpentine in appearance.
[/p]

[h3]Body[sup]1[/sup][/h3]

[p]
Due to their aerodynamic nature, by default, most SkyWings are fairly lean assuming they stick to a typical and healthy diet. This oftentimes leads to a smaller profile overall, but is compensated for the sheer volume of size SkyWings take up. Furthermore, because of this leanness, the overall scale-count of a SkyWing is typically fewer than their bulkier counterparts, but it often matters not, for the scales nevertheless heavily cover the sides and back of the body, only leaving a yellowish to white underbelly beneath. Notably, there is also a lack of a sail, unlike that of SandWings or SeaWings, and instead a long ridge of horn-like formations jut out from the spinal portion of the body instead, which are tough and keratinous, similar that of their horns.[sup]1[/sup]
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Wings[sup]1[/sup][/h3]

[p]
Unlike that of other Tribes, the SkyWings are known particularly due to their distinctively large wings, which when at rest, sometimes nearly overtakes their own bodies in terms of height. Their wingspan far outstretches that of their overall body-length from snout to tip-of-tail, and for good use too, as their wings act as membranous sails that catch even the slightest changes in the wind.[sup]1[/sup]
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Coloration[/h2]
[p]Similarly to their general form, SkyWings have no sex-based differences in either coloration or patternation. All SkyWings have an identical primary, secondary, and tertiary color range. Just as well, any SkyWing can have the same patterns as their sistren or brethren. Importantly, not all listed locations of coloration are absolute. That is, deviations from what is asserted are not only possible, but more than likely.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Primary[/h3]
[p]
A SkyWing's primary coloration typically affects the platescales found on the neck and back, as well as the outer face of the forearms and hind legs. This color is often highly saturated and can best be described as warm and fiery. It is uncommon for a SkyWing to be a pastel hue. It is impossible, except under specific conditions, for a SkyWing to be pure white or pure black. In descending order of frequency within the majority of the tribe's population, SkyWings are usually bright reds, oranges, yellows, and other similar colors.
[/p]

[h3]Secondary[/h3]
[p]
Acting as an accent to the primary color, secondary coloration affects the [tooltip:Scales that act as an intermediary between two separate scaletypes.]transitionary scales[/tooltip] between the larger platescales of the back and underbelly, as well as the wing arms and their digits. Generally, this color is a desaturated version of an individual's primary color with white being fairly common. Black is rare, if not impossible, to have manifest here. If the secondary is different from the primary, then the secondary can be any color within the primary range. 
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Tertiary[/h3]
[p]
In terms of solid coloration, SkyWings have no more than three colors. This tertiary color affects only the indiviudals wings' membranes, any other membrane-like appendages, and oftentimes the color of the individual's patterns. The tertiary range is generally identical to the primary range. However, the tertiary color is much more likely to deviate from the primary range when compared to both the primary and the secondary ranges. Essentially, it is uncommon, but not exceedingly rare, for a SkyWing's tertiary color to be something radically deviant, such as purple or green. 
[/p]

[h3]Miscellaneous[/h3]
[p]
The remaining colors found on the SkyWing body are too specific to justify an entire section be dedicated to them. However, this should not detract from their importance in considering the overall makeup of any individual SkyWIng. Their horns will often be pearly white that yellows with age or pitch black that grows lighter with age; their talons, teeth, and spines are the same. The eyes will most likely have white sclera, black pupils, and amber colored irises.
[/p]
[/col][/row]
[p]
[h3]Patternation[/h3]
[p]
Finally, all SkyWings share a similar range of possible patterns. Specifically, any SkyWing can have starbursts, splotches, and striation develop on their scales. Any combination of these patterns can develop and they can cover any portion of the individual's body. For example, a SkyWing can either be fully covered in patterns or only have it on the back of their palms. Additionally, the pattern can be an explosion of geometry, or a splotches of stripes. Patterns often share a color. The color is often determined by tertiary color, however, it is common for SkyWings to even have a quaternary color. In rare cases, this quaternary color can be anything visible to dragons.
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Physiology[/h1]
[h2]Perceptions[/h2]
[p]
Most SkyWings have an identical set of sensory capabilities. These sensitivies unaffected by an individual's sex. A typical SkyWing likely has an average tactile sense and would be able to feel any small object that they touch or are touched by. They will likely have an average palate that allows them to notice most spices in foods and are likely sensitive to sour, bitter, sweet, and savory flavors. They will more than likely have an excellent [tooltip:It is very common for even average SkyWings to grossly outperform virtually every other tribe in contests that judge clear viewing distance and accuracy of depth perception.]visual acuity[/tooltip]. Finally, a typical SkyWing will likely have a somewhat better than average sense of hearing that would allow them to discern relative location and estimate distance based on sound.
[/p]

[h2] Universal Abilities [/h2]
[br]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Firebreathing[/h3]
[p]
All SkyWings are able to @[breathe fire](article:39f40173-59b2-489a-8127-0a75ab6b8208), and the SkyWing tribe specifically possesses the hottest average temperature for the power on @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f). At an average heat of eleven hundred degrees Celsius, SkyWings are able to fully melt gold without the assistance of a forge and are naturally able to overpower all but the strongest @[fire resistant armors](article:476b22bc-f0ed-418a-93f8-790436868a8f). This power relies on an individual SkyWing's internal body temperature rather than external, environmental temperature. This allows conditions such as hyperthermia and hypothermia to have a great effect on flame temperature. All SkyWings possess a mucus that lines the inside of their throat and mouth. This mucus acts as insulation and prevents one from burning their own internal organs. It is constantly replenishing itself after every blast of fire and is worn down with every second of active fire breathing. After about thirty seconds of sustained fire, a SkyWing's protection will have fully burned away and they will begin to suffer extreme internal damage. This is called overburning and is almost always fatal, as it burns away the inside of the throat and mouth. Overburning is fatal in almost every single instance.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Aeronautical Affinity[/h3]
[p]
Most SkyWings possess extremely versatile and well-rounded flight abilities. A typical SkyWing is able to soar for extended periods of time while carrying additional loads equal to their own body weight. Not only this, but they will also be able to reach breakneck speeds for longer periods of time. Lightweight frames, dense muscles, and dynamic wing structure allows for these incredible feats to be commonplace among the tribe. Nearly all SkyWings are accomplished flyers and are exceptionally talented at aerobatics. The only dragons that can outperform a SkyWing in maneuverability are @HiveWings(species), who benefit from a specialized method of flight and are thus much more maneuverable at their baseline than SkyWing competitors. The only place where most SkyWings can falter while in the air is when they must remain stationary or make tight, sudden turns.

[h2]Limited Abilities[/h2]
[h3]Firestealing[/h3]
[p]
When a SkyWing egg containing twins is laid, there is a significant chance for a phenomenon known as firestealing to occur. Firestealing is an anomalous process wherein one occupant of the egg steals the [tooltip:An analog for the soul and general life force of all things with the potential to change.]fire[/tooltip] of their sibling. While the mechanism by which this process functions is not fully understood, the effects are very thoroughly documented. The result of this phenomenon is the birth of two specially powered dragonets: a firescales and an ashscales.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h4]Firescales[/h4]
[p]
Empowered by the stolen fire of their sibling, a firescales is best described by a common SkyWing metaphor: [i]"If all normal SkyWings burn like campfires, then all firescales burn like bonfires."[/i] Firescales burn so fervently, in fact, that a defining characteristic of these dangerous dragons is the extreme heat that they radiate. The scales on a firescales have a contact temperature of eleven hundred degrees Celsius and a [tooltip: The heat emitted by an object, rather than the temperature of the object itself.]radiant temperature[/tooltip] of half that. This makes standing in close proximity remarkably risky as even brief contact can cause severe burns, and prolonged contact will inevitably melt the flesh off of bone. Even if no contact is made, many claim that it is wholly uncomfortable to stand near a firescales, especially in enclosed spaces. The internal body temperature of a given firescales is often two to three times greater than that of a normal SkyWing. The fiery scaletype that covers a firescales' body is wholly immune to @frostbreath(article) and the @[FIrebreath](article:39f40173-59b2-489a-8127-0a75ab6b8208) of every other Pyrrhian. It also burns away @[Rainwing](species:f08d3c96-0981-466c-a92d-814bd79dad72) venom mid-flight and evaporates the inert liquid on contact. It is important to note, however, that only [i]scaled[/i] portions of a firescales' body exhibit these properties. Specifically, internal structures, such as the mouth, have no resistance to anything aforementioned and do not possess any unique properties. Firescales often look identical to other SkyWings. The only noticeable and common deviations from normalcy are a firescales electric blue eyes and bright orange veins on their wings. 
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h4]Ashscales[/h4]
[p]
As the sibling who's fire was stolen, an ashscales hardly burns at all. Named for their oftentimes ashen appearance, these dragons are almost always sickly and appear underdeveloped for their respective age. An ashscales' complexion is often a desaturated variant of a typical SkyWing. Ashscales in general suffer from a wide number of physical ailments. They tend to be physically weaker, flying at the fraction of the SkyWing average; grow much slower and much less in comparison to their non-ashscale sistren; be much more susceptible to illness; and are much more fragile overall. Despite this, ashscales tend to be accomplished academics and champions in scholarly fields. Their minds are generally much sharper and they are often highly intelligent individuals. Some of the most renowned innovators and thinkers of the era have been ashscales. Lastly, and mostly anomalously, ashscales have an immunity to the special scale properties of their cousins. This means, specifically, that ashscales do not feel the radiant or contact heat of their firescale twin, blood related or otherwise. The reasons for this are not fully understood, and it is unknown whether this is a property of the ashscale or of the firescale. 
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[hr]
[h1]Ecology[/h1]

[h2]Habitat[/h2]
[p]
Nearly all SkyWings prefer alpine environments. The higher elevations and colder climate of the @[Taloned Mountains](location:df6cd164-44ef-4d70-aed8-411734f68d0e) are a perfect example of ideal SkyWing locales. They can tolerate living in locations closer to sea level, as well as in the southern strip of the @[Frozen Peninsula](location:a66fafa4-df43-4ffb-b962-6881bcf218f4). The only biome in which SkyWings cannot survive are those that are exceedingly hot, excessively humid, or both. This makes areas such as the @Rainforest(geography), @[Great Desert](location:fbb17d26-6ac4-4a7f-b3ea-4e9f7a88340f), and virtually all of @[Pantala](location:326aae77-9f26-4124-91ea-e31a4e23a695) uninhabitable by SkyWing standards. SkyWings prefer solitary living spaces carved out of, or built with, stone. Claiming a spacious cavern is also rather commonplace. Despite the instinctive desire to live alone, many SkyWings also possess an instinctive sense of community and enjoy a sort of distant company. Tribe members tend to form incredibly loyal and tight knit neighborhoods consisting of friends and family. 
[/p]

[h2]Diet[/h2]
[p]
All SkyWings are carnivorous and the average SkyWing's diet will consist of mostly venisons and fowl meats. Additionally, their most preferred meals also tend to be what their diet mostly consists of, with the only additions being sweet alpine fruits and berries, or whatever sweet treats can be found within their territory. SkyWings are very strict in what they are able to properly digest with omnivorous or carrion-based diets being nearly unsustainable. Herbivorous diets are outright unsustainable, and in some cases have been shown to rapidly increase the rate of starvation. Despite this, many SkyWings benefit from medicinal remedies as long as they are properly prepared. Tinctures and other similar treatments have been used to great effect for generations. SkyWings tend to eat about three meals per day, with severe symptoms of starvation occurring after about four days with very little to no food. Total starvation will kill a SkyWing after about two weeks. The tribe also tends to dehydrate at a rate considered average among Pantalans, with severe symptoms manifesting after only three days. Most SkyWings will die after five days without water. SkyWings are endurance hunters, opting to chase down prey. When availab le, many will utilize ranching in order to offset the time it takes to hunt. Interestingly, many SkyWings prefer to hunt even when livestock is abundant. 
[/p]

[h2]Reproduction[/h2]
[p]
SkyWings are an oviparous tribe that reproduces sexually. The average clutch size for most SkyWings is three, however, this can be greater or lesser depending on the number of twin eggs, if any. Each egg takes about twenty-six hours to form before they are laid. Average nesting for most SkyWings consists of an outer perimeter made of alpine grasses and other insulating material. Heated rocks are then placed in the basin of these nests. These egg warmers are often taken out and reheated by a parent. Finally, the eggs are place on top, inside the newly created nest. Nests are often placed in crevasses or other naturally defensible locations nearby, or often inside, the parents' home. SkyWing eggs require constantly high temperatures, low humidty, and roughly twelve lunar cycles to hatch. Eggs are an oblong shape, offwhite in color, and smooth in tecture. Twin eggs can be identified by their monstrous size, often being double or even triple the size of a normal SkyWing egg.
[/p]

[h2]Lifecycle[/h2]
[p]
SkyWing hatchlings are born altricial with immediate access to their perceptions. Once fully developed within the egg, an infant SkyWing will break through the shell and remain in their nests until given initial care by a parent. Often, hatchlings make high pitched, staccato vocalizations until initially tended by a parent. Twins afflicted by firestealing have similar post-hatching behavior. Newborn SkyWings are fully ambulatory after only one day and are volant after one week. After only one lunar cycle, most dragonets will have developed basic linguistic ability in the language they are most exposed to. Normal SkyWings will develop their firebreath after about ten days. Firescale and ashscale traits manifest immediately after hatching. Baby SkyWings are considered adolescent dragonets after the complete initial development of all universal abilities, which typically takes one full lunar year. All abilities and perceptions grow stronger, proportionally, with age. Adolescent dragonets are considered biological adults at eight lunar years, with sexual maturity marking this milestone. All SkyWings suffer from senescence and thus have a maximum lifespan of one hundred fifty lunar years. Unfortunately, the average lifespan of most SkyWings is about fifty five lunar years.[/p][/p]

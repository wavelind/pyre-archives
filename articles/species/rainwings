Beautifully dangerous and dangerously beautiful, RainWings represent all that is sublime about dragonkind. They stand out against the darkness with their splendid colors and effervescent temperament. It would take a dark god eons to stifle the blazing passion in these wyrms' hearts.  | Dreamwalker Solstice, [i]"Musings of a Poet"[/i]

[h2]Anatomy[/h2]
[row]
[col]
[h3]Height[/h3]
[p]
All RainWings stand at around four meters tall at the shoulder. RainWings also have the shortest wingspan on @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f), being only ten meters across.
[/p]

[h3]Weight[/h3]
[p]
All RainWings weigh just about two tonnes, or two thousand kilograms. In this regard, the tribe just barely ranks as the second smallest tribe on @[Pyrrhia](location:5f158d52-c163-4041-94a9-a4162f55853b), with members only being larger than the average @[SeaWing](species:0cd789c0-7f2e-47f8-b703-55c4cb51f8bb).
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Speed[/h3]
[p]
A rather large minority of RainWings are able to achieve sustained flight despite their below average. Most RainWings can only glide, but of the population that can fly, the average cruising speed has been recorded as about fifteen knots with a record of twenty-five knots.
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]

[h2]Form[/h2]
[p]
RainWings have no common dimorphisms among members of their tribes, thus making it moderately difficult to distinguish females from males at first glance. All RainWings tend to be slim and lithe with salamander-like builds. In addition to this, RainWings are usually rather fragile and can sustain serious injury from impacts that would hardly wind some other, tougher, Pyrrhians. Conversely, most RainWings have absolutely stunning core strength, dexterity, and agility which is demonstrated in their ability to traverse the @Rainforest(location), as well as in how they maneuver around their environments in general.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Head[/h3]
[p]
Most RainWings will likely have a long snout with a triangular head that ends in a small, bulbous beak. On the end of their snout, between the upper part of the nostrils, is a small horn. On the far back of their lower jaw is a set of similar horns on both sides. Their horns are long, thin, and S-shaped, and their ears sit right below in a downwards angle. Beginning at the base of the head and on either side of the neck and behind the ears is a large ruff. This ruff is very similar to the ruff of a frilled lizard, and is often referred to as a RainWing's frill. It has an appearance similar to that of a SeaWing's fin and is made of a similar, if not identical, material, thus the RainWings' frill has radially protruding spines that are connected by a durable membrane.
[/p]

[h3]Body[/h3]
[p]
The neck of a typical RainWing is rather non-unique in comparison to other tribes. There are small plates which protrude from the center-top of the neck and flow down to the end of the tail and it is important to note that RainWings have the longest and most maneuverable necks of any dragon on @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f). Their back is arched at rest and their bat-like wings tend to be thinner at their base, widening as length increases. The wings also mark the beginning of scale transition from hard outer scales to softer underbelly scales. RainWings are unique in the sense that their underbelly is segmented, with seams appearing at regular intervals as the stomach itself domes outwards. They have harder scales padding the front of their forelimbs and hindlimbs and their talons are curled and long, allowing for adequate grip onto tree trunks and branches with greater comfort. Lastly, their tail is very long and thin, but exceptionally strong and prehensile, able to hold the weight of an average RainWing on top of the user’s own body weight.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Wings[/h3]
[p]
The average RainWing has a set of bat-like wings that are fairly standard in comparison to other Pyrrhians. The membrane connects directly to the body and is divided into five segments. Each segment is separated by a long digit in a configuration once again analogous to bats. The wing shoulders sit right above the forearm shoulders.
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]

[h2]Coloration[/h2]
[p]
All RainWings share a primary, secondary, and tertiary color range. An important distinction to make is that this section only describes the at-rest coloration of a typical RainWing and does not address the unique tribal power that allows RainWings to manipulate their scale and eye colors. While there are listed locations for where the colors affect, it is important to note that these are merely typical spots. That is, the most common among the tribe. Furthermore, it is entirely possibly, if not just unlikely, that deviations from what is listed below exist in the wild.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Primary[/h3]
[p]
A RainWing’s primary color range encompasses the entire color spectrum apart from white and black. The primary color affects nearly all of the scales on a RainWing aside from the underbelly, wing membrane, frill membrane, and tougher front-facing scales on the limbs and wing arms. 
[/p]

[h3]Secondary[/h3]
[p]
A RainWing’s secondary range is as inclusive as their primary range, although not excluding white or black. Secondary color affects primarily the underbelly and tougher front-facing scales on limbs and wing arms.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Tertiary[/h3]
[p]
A RainWing's tertiary color range follows the same restrictions as the secondary range. Tertiary color affects the frill and wing membranes.
[/p]

[h3]Miscellaneous[/h3]
[p]
RainWings have white horns and talons that turn yellow with age. Their eyes’ sclera is white, their pupils black, and irises limitless in potential color. In addition, many RainWings have one variant of heterochromia.
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]
[p]
[h3]Patternation[/h3]
[p]
RainWing patternation is nearly limitless, however, it is too random to be useful for any more than individual identification and, due to the aforementioned scale-changing powers, it would prove particularly difficult to guarantee that a RainWing is not mimicking another’s patterns. The colors of these patterns tend to be a quaternary color with equally limitless potential.
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Physiology[/h1]
[h2]Perceptions[/h2]
[p]
All RainWings share a set of sensory abilities. A typical RainWing will have an average tactile sense, being able to feel small objects that they touch as well as are touched by. Their sense of taste will also be average, allowing them to notice most spices within foods, as well as other bitter, sweet, savory, and sour flavors. Their eyesight is about average, with an unremarkable visual acuity and clear viewing distance. Their sense of smell is also unremarkable, being able to discern select spices in foods as well as track most wildlife and other tribes. Their sense of hearing is unremarkable, allowing them to only estimate distance and source. Interestingly, the average RainWing will have a better time seeing in no-light or low-light conditions. Finally, all RainWings are able to innately detect imperceivable RainWings. However, this ability does not extend towards NightWings’ shadow concealment.
[/p]

[h2] Universal Abilities [/h2]
[row]
[col]
[h3]Corrosive Toxin[/h3]
[p]
In place of a conventional breath weapon, RainWings possess a pair of retractable fangs that connect to a pair of glands in the back of the throat. These glands contain a toxin, colloquially misnamed “RainWing venom”, that is highly corrosive and toxic. This toxin is capable of dissolving all forms of plant life and animal flesh but will leave inorganic materials, such as stones and metals, unscathed. RainWing venom is both a venom, as well as a poison due to its lethality and severity after coming into any kind of contact with living creatures. Upon contact, it will dissolve and mix with the now liquified target, turning into a pulp and becoming inert. RainWings are able to eject this toxin from their fangs, and most RainWings are able to accurately hit targets up to ten meters away. This makes RainWings have one of the most precise breath weapons on the entire planet. In addition, RainWing fangs are robust enough to be able to pierce softscale which allows RainWings to directly inject their venom for devastating effect on a target. The toxin itself is incredibly viscous and adhesive. This makes it difficult to remove and greatly adds to its severity. Lastly, it is only dangerous when not pulpified and physically touched. Fresh venom has a glittering black appearance, with speckles of various prominent colors. Inert venom loses all of its speckles and becomes a grey tinted by whatever the color of its dissolved material was. This inert venom is still syrup-like, however, it is completely safe to handle. Both fresh and inert venom have a pungent vanilla odor. 
[/p]

[h3]Photodependence[/h3]
[p]
All RainWings rely heavily on [Salix] and its sunlight to survive. This is independent of the tribe’s need to eat and breathe, as RainWings cannot subsist entirely on sunlight, even if it is in plentiful amounts. Despite this, many processes within a RainWings body require adequate amounts of sunlight in order to function properly. While specific functions are not known, the consequences of sunlight starvation, “sunstarvation”, are well documented. Sunstarving is best described as not absorbing enough, or any, sunlight. If a RainWing does not absorb enough sunlight, they will develop many debilitating afflictions. Symptoms of sunstarving include: increased fatigue; visual, auditory, and tactile hallucination; increased weakness; increased confusion; impaired judgment; deterioration of fine motor skills; and many more. These symptoms are typically temporary but can become chronic if an individual is sunstarved repeatedly for long periods. Symptom severity increases as time without sunlight exposure increases. Symptoms will begin to manifest after only one day of sunstarvation with death occurring after about four or five days of extended starvation. Due to these consequences, and a less effective sun absorption method, RainWings have developed methods for properly absorbing enough sunlight to avoid sunstarving. These methods have been collectively named “suntime”. Suntime involves sleeping in full sunlight exposure for about three hours every day, being drawn to sources of light, flaring of the ruff, and oscillating one’s scale patterns which is believed to enhance absorption. These phenomena usually begin to manifest towards the middle of the day, when @[Salix](article:d40b3411-6d0a-4bdd-a528-1073786af17c) is at its highest point in the sky. These processes are so vital and ingrained within most RainWings that an individual’s circadian rhythm is tuned to it. This means RainWings that are awake when midday approaches will begin to feel exhausted and lethargic and enter a trancelike state. This lasts until the RainWing begins suntime or until Salix sets. Remaining awake during, and after, suntime after skipping it is incredibly difficult. Only those who specifically train to skip it are able to overcome it.

[h3]Imperceptible Camouflage[/h3]
[p]
Through anomalous processes, all RainWings are able to completely prevent themselves from being visually perceived. Dragons, or targets, who are within viewing distance of a concealed RainWing will no longer be able to see the hidden individual. This affects all creatures able to see. A RainWing is able to utilize this ability in any environment and condition, and it even is able to deceive targets who watched the ability manifest, appearing to them as if the RainWing is gradually fading away. This power is much stronger than traditional camouflage because it does not rely on the breaking of a silhouette. Instead, it literally alters a target’s ability to visually perceive. Despite this, it only affects a target’s sight, and targets are still able to hear, smell, and touch concealed RainWings. Along with this, concealed RainWings still affect the world around them, and can be perceived in that way. For example, talon prints will still be made in the snow, sticks will still snap in half, tall grasses will still be separated when traversed through. Lastly, this power is immensely draining, as a concealed RainWing will need to actively focus and concentrate on maintaining the illusion. It has been described as feeling similar to holding one’s breath and after prolonged concealment it can begin to become physically painful and the illusion will break after causing a RainWing to blackout. The duration of which can last seconds to hours. This power can be somewhat trained, as practice and technique can allow a RainWing to conceal themselves for longer. However, even the most trained and experienced members of the tribe are able to maintain this illusion for only up to ten minutes. 
[/p]

[h3]Colorshift[/h3]
[p]
All RainWings are able to shift their scales’ hue and saturation. This ranges from individual scale to whole body changes. This power takes intense concentration when first attempting it, however, it is possible for it to become subconscious or “second nature” with enough practice. Complicated and complex patterns will require extra effort in proportion to how unfamiliar the pattern is to the individual. In addition to this conscious color shifting, all RainWings can have their scales shift without an individual willing it to happen. This automatic shifting is primarily caused by extreme emotion or distress. Blind, young, and overwhelmed RainWings will have their emotions “spill out” onto their scales. Every individual has a different corresponding color for each emotion, however trends definitely exist tribewide. These colors mix additively, accounting for “mixed emotions”. When extremely stressed, RainWings will automatically match their scales to the colors of the background. This will always happen unless the specific RainWing has trained to prevent this from happening. This “camouflage” aligns itself to be as effective as possible from the perspective of a perceived threat. This camouflage is not the same as a RainWing’s concealment ability and rather relies on the breaking of a silhouette.

[/row]

[h2]Limited Abilities[/h2]
[p]
There are no known limited abilities that manifest, or have manifested, enough to justify further detail. It is entirely possible that there are undocumented powers that can be found within the tribe. Hybrids are the only common possessors of non-standard powers and, as expected, those powers are inherited from the non-RainWing parent.

[hr]
[h1]Ecology[/h1]

[h2]Habitat[/h2]
[p]
RainWings prefer to live in hot, humid environments with lots of rainfall and biodiversity. Locations such as the @Rainforest(location) and jungles of @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f) are considered excellent by RainWing standards. RainWings can tolerate biomes such as tropical zones, like the @Bay of a Thousand Scales(location), as well as savannas and grasslands. Temperate zones with short winters harbor significant RainWing populations. RainWings struggle to survive in alpine environments due to their climate and vertical geography. They essentially cannot survive in tundras such as the @[Great Desert](location:fbb17d26-6ac4-4a7f-b3ea-4e9f7a88340f) and @[Frozen Peninsula](location:a66fafa4-df43-4ffb-b962-6881bcf218f4). RainWings prefer to live off the ground in suspended platforms, typically in trees or dragon-made raised homes. They live in communities of about ten or more and units are usually made up of adopted family members and close friends. 
[/p]

[h2]Diet[/h2]
[p]
Virtually all RainWings are herbivorous. Specifically speaking, they are mostly frugivores. The average RainWing diet consists of mostly fruits, fruit-like parts, and nuts. This average diet also happens to be the most preferred within the tribe. RainWings are able to somewhat survive on more nutritiously limited vegetation such as grasses and leaves, however, strictly living on these sources would be unsustainable. RainWings cannot digest meat of any kind and most cannot even bear the thought of trying to consume carrion. The tribe benefits quite a lot from the usage of herbal remedies and medicines. RainWings tend to eat about four meals per day and starve at an average rate. Severe symptoms occur after one week with total starvation will occur in only three weeks with little to no food. Additionally, the average RainWing dehydrates at a normal rate. Symptoms of severe dehydration manifest after only two days, with death being nearly guaranteed after only seven days without water. Fortunately, this is offset by their diet. RainWings acquire food through wild foraging, gardening, and even local trade such as bartering if possible.
[/p]

[h2]Reproduction[/h2]
[p]
Rainwings are an oviparous tribe that reproduces sexually. A female and male will mate in order to produce offspring and the mother’s resulting clutch will contain about three eggs. Each egg takes about twenty-four hours to form. Most RainWings will nest in trees local to the rainforest and build a hammock-like nest within the branches using accessible fibers. Laid eggs will then be placed in these hammocks and covered with large fronds or other leaves that can be wrapped over the opening of the nest. These nests are often beside the mother’s chosen home. RainWing eggs require warm, moist conditions to develop and hatch properly. Hatching occurs after one lunar year of development. A RainWing’s egg is typically oblong in shape, a solid dark green color with speckles of black, and possesses a rough texture.
[/p]

[h2]Lifecycle[/h2]
[p]
RainWings are born precocial with immediate access to their perceptions. Once a baby RainWing fully develops within the egg it will then attempt to break free using an egg-tooth to crack the shell. Once the shell is cracked, the newborn will use its claws to break the rest of the egg and escape. The newly hatched RainWing will softly wail in a way that sounds similar to a mewling kitten. This will continue until a RainWing is retrieved by a parent. It takes two days for an infant RainWing to be able to ambulate and thirteen days before they become as volant as the average RainWing can be. It takes one lunar cycle of exposure for a baby RainWing to achieve beginner, conversational fluency in the language they are most exposed to. Most universal abilities will begin to manifest after ten days. Photodependence manifests immediately after hatching. An infant RainWing is considered adolescent after they gain conscious control over their color shifting and camouflage. This is usually after one lunar year. A RainWing's corrosive acid and perceptions will increase proportionally with age. Their color shifting and camouflage grows exponentially stronger until plateauing towards sexual maturity. It takes seven lunar years for a RainWing to become sexually mature and it marks the official transition from adolescent to adult. RainWings suffer from senescence and as such they have a maximum life span of one-hundred fifty years. Despite this, RainWing life expectancy is only forty-five lunar years.

Within the hustle and bustle of any hive is an intricate, complex, and living machine. Each dragon, a multitoothed cog, knows their place within their home's grand design. Their unity is their greatest strength and would-be invaders should heed the warning: Woe be upon thee who dare disturb the swarm. | General Ember Evergreen, [i]"A Treatise on Panthian Conquest"[/i]

[h1]Morphology[/h1]
[h2]Anatomy[/h2]
[row]
[col]
[h3]Height[/h3]
[p]
In terms of height, HiveWings are below average. A typical dragoness stands at around three meters at her shoulder and the typical dragon stands at about four meters at his shoulder. Both  are likely to have wingspans of eight meters from starboard to portside, with a special description due to the unique quadwing configuration all pure HiveWings possess. This gives HiveWings some of the shortest wingspans on @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f). 
[/p]

[h3]Weight[/h3]
[p]
In terms of weight, a healthy HiveWing dragoness most often weighs around one and a half tonnes, or one thousand five hundred kilograms and a healthy dragon will weigh around two tonnes, or two thousand kilograms. This makes HiveWings considerably lighter than most other Panthians except for @[SilkWings](species:71e4e0ea-00c4-430c-999c-f551fd445e1e), and lighter than any tribe on @[Pyrrhia](location:5f158d52-c163-4041-94a9-a4162f55853b)
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Speed[/h3]
[p]
Furthermore, HiveWing dragonesses have a cruising speed of thirty knots and a maximum speed of about forty-five knots. HiveWing dragons have a cruising speed of twenty-five knots and a maximum speed of forty knots. The fastest recorded HiveWing could only reach a little over these typical numbers, with the female record being fifty-five knots and the male record being fifty knots. This makes HiveWings some of the slowest flyers on Panthia, tying for second-to-last with @[SilkWings](species:71e4e0ea-00c4-430c-999c-f551fd445e1e) and @[SeaWings](species:0cd789c0-7f2e-47f8-b703-55c4cb51f8bb) and only being faster than @[RainWings](species:f08d3c96-0981-466c-a92d-814bd79dad72) by fifteen knots.

[h2]Form[/h2]
[p]
Overall, HiveWings are slender, lithe, thin, and have much more fragile builds than other tribes. In direct comparison, they tend to be physically weaker and more prone to injury. However, HiveWings, in comparison to other tribes, have much greater proportional strength, meaning that HiveWings are able to manipulate objects with weights that far exceed that of their own body, even if that weight is something that is only average for a typical Pyrrhian. HiveWings are also quite nimble and agile, owing to their wings and needle-like appendages. Their overall appearance and silhouette is best described as sharp and spiked, and this is only exemplified by their razor-sharp carapaces and spines.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Head[/h3]
[p]
A female HiveWing will have a long, tall snout that is horizontally angular and best described as axe-like. This sis further reinforced by the ridge at the end of their snouts that is similar to an axehead. She will also have a rather distinct barbed horn on the middle of her snout which is angled backward similarly to her primary horns. Her primary horns begin at the very top, back of her head and curve backwards in an S-shape, ending in an upwards taper. Her ears are long and thin and protrude from the top back corner of either side of her head. A male HiveWing shares a good number of his sisters' traits, however, there are some important distinctions. First, male HiveWings lack the horn in the middle of their snouts, leaving it smooth and flat. Seconds, his horns curve back then away from his head, ending in a taper.
[/p]

[h3]Body[/h3]
[p]
The neck of a female HiveWing has individual, independent spines that run from the top of her head to the tip of her tail. She has larger platescales that cover her outer neck and are similar in appearance to the platescales found on @[MudWings](species:387caa71-4e59-47c6-857f-06bd88c247a0), however, HiveWing scales are not nearly as resilient. These scales then transition into comparably softer underscales that cover her inner neck. Her wing shoulders merge directly into her forearm shoulders and her back is rather nondescript aside from her wings which are uniquely configured in a way that is only shared by @[SilkWings](species:71e4e0ea-00c4-430c-999c-f551fd445e1e). Her waist is thin, however, her ribcage is exceptionally pronounced and extends about a quarter down her forearms, making it only a little less extreme than SilkWings. Her underbelly has a soft scaletype but is harder in comparison to the underbelly scales of most other tribes. Her legs and forearms are thin and lack traditional scales, instead she has tiny clusters of scales on her limbs that have a leathery texture. Her palms are wide and her digits are long and spaced out, ending in fine pointed, downward curving talons. Her tail is thin and tapers off. As for male HiveWings, their waists are larger, becoming almost even with the rest of the ribcage, and their limbs are thicker. Overall, a male HiveWing will appear to look much rounder and softer than his sister. 
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Wings[/h3]

[p]
Two pairs of equally sized wings make up the quadwing system. The wings closest to her head and neck are her forewings and the wings closest to her tail are her hindwings. As both sets are nearly identical in form and function, they will be referred to as a collective unless specification is necessary. A female HiveWing’s wings are segmented and inflexible. The midpoint of an individual wing is its anatomical elbow and marks the beginning, or end, of a segment. This midpoint also acts as a vertex, and the segments create an obtuse angle that points towards the ground when the wing is at rest. She has a lower aspect ratio and higher flap frequency than any other tribe on [Panthia]. The membranes of her wings are a much more rigid material and appear almost glossy and transparent rather than leathery. She flaps her forewings consciously, however, the counter flapping of her hindwings is subconscious, and it is rather difficult to consciously move her hindwings. 
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Coloration[/h2]
[p]
Both female and male HiveWings share nearly identical primary color ranges, and totally identical secondary, and tertiary color ranges. Additionally, all HiveWings share a pool of patterns that they can possess.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Primary[/h3]
[p]
All HiveWings have a warm primary color range. This means that a HiveWing tends to be orange, red, yellow, or any mix of the three. Female HiveWings have access to dark greens and browns as well. This typically only affects an individual’s platescales that run from the neck to the tip of the tail and cover a majority of the body.
[/p]

[h3]Secondary[/h3]
[p]
All HiveWings’ secondary color range follows the same limitations as the primary range of a female HiveWing, so warm colors along with green and brown. Secondary color usually affects the fore and hind limbs, underbelly, and wing arms.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Tertiary[/h3]
[p]
A HiveWing’s tertiary color range is a brighter, more desaturated variant of their primary color range. Typically, tertiary color is a variant of an individual’s primary color. Tertiary color affects the fore and hind wings’ membranes, as well as any gradient found on the HiveWing themselves.
[/p]

[h3]Miscellaneous[/h3]
[p]
All HiveWings have black talons and black horns that turn to gray with age. Their sclera is usually a warm color, their irises are black, and their pupils are the same color as their sclera. Interestingly, many believe that HiveWings have eyes with special properties due to how they seem to luminesce in low to no-light environments. 
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]
[p]
[h3]Patternation[/h3]
[p]
HiveWings have somewhat diverse patternation. The tribe almost exclusively follows insect patternation, therefore if it can be found on insects and arachnids, there is likely a HiveWing who has it. Symmetrical patterns, like those found on butterflies; striped patterns, like those found on bees and wasps; and dotted patternation, such as those found on spiders are all considered valid and plausible. The colors of these patterns are typically a quaternary color and have seemingly no hard limit in terms of what they can be.
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Physiology[/h1]
[h2]Perceptions[/h2]
[p]
All HiveWings share a range of sensory abilities. A HiveWing’s tactile sense is rather plain, allowing them to feel small objects they touch as well as are touched by. Their sense of taste is unremarkable, allowing them to notice most spices in foods in addition to bitter, sweet, savory, and sour flavors. Their eyesight is notoriously poor, considered to have a very low visual acuity. Essentially, nearly all HiveWings are horribly nearsighted. Their sense of smell is incredibly powerful, allowing for them to detect composition and disease, as well as distinguish multiple objects and where they likely were in a given room. Lastly, their hearing is average, with HiveWings being able to estimate location and source of most sounds. An interesting power that most HiveWings have is the ability to detect barometric pressure changes. This essentially allows most HiveWings to detect incoming storms. In addition, most HiveWings are more sensitive to vibrations in any medium. 
[/p]

[h2]Universal Abilities[/h2]
[row]
[col]
[h3]Aerodexterity[/h3]
[p]
All HiveWings benefit from their specialized method of flight derived from their quadwing configuration. Their fast-moving, low inertia wings allow them to have incredibly high amounts of maneuverability within the air. HiveWings are able to rotate in complete three hundred sixty degree circles; orient themselves in place; and fly in all cardinal and intermediate directions while facing relative North. Not only this, but they are able to achieve these feats while staying almost completely motionless and hovering. The greatest drawback of the quadwing configuration is that it makes HiveWings slow flyers and it requires unbelievable amounts of training and stamina to reach proficient levels of flying for even the most naturally talented flyers of the tribe. Not only this, but the energy costs make intense aerial maneuvers completely draining, and high aerial activity can even begin to starve a HiveWing. 
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Waxbuilding[/h3]
[p]
All HiveWings are able to convert digested foodstuffs into a versatile construction material called hivewax. Fresh hivewax is a soft, malleable, and hydrophobic material that can be hardened into resilient and durable forms and shapes. It also has the same appearance and texture as beeswax. Hivewax is created through an internal process utilizing the contents of a HiveWing’s stomach. The exact method of creation is not fully understood, however, production volume can be accurately estimated. Meats allow for greater hivewax production than non-meats and males are able to produce twice the amount of hivewax as females. Hivewax production can take a considerable toll on the body of any HiveWing, and even the most hardy dragons are only able to create about thirty pounds of hivewax in a day. Exhaustion, weakness, and the effects of malnutrition are common symptoms of hivewax overproduction. After about two pounds of hivewax has been produced internally, the producing HiveWing will regurgitate the newly formed material. Once exposed to the open air, the hivewax will begin to harden over the course of three to four days. During this time, however, it is incredibly easy to manipulate with tools and one’s talons. Once hivewax has fully hardened it becomes virtually impossible to mold but it does not become brittle. Hardened hivewax has many of the same properties as @Sky Steel(materials), while not being softened by the use of heat.

[/row]

[h2]Limited Abilities[/h2]
[h3]Stinger Neurotoxin[/h3]
[p]
All hatched HiveWings have a chance to be born with a particularly severe weapon. This weapon is a stinger capable of injecting a potent neurotoxin. This neurotoxin is non-lethal in most circumstances, and is capable of inflicting agonizing pain onto a target. This pain has been described as “feeling like every scale on your body was set on fire” and is so intense that an indirect symptom of being stung is temporary immobilization. Symptoms of the neurotoxin itself tend to be muscle spasms, nerve pain, partial paralysis, and a myriad of other debilitating afflictions. As a whole, this power has been described by victims as leaving them “pleading for the release of death.” 
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h4]Paralyzing Venom[/h4]
[p]
One variant of the neurotoxin described beforehand also exists somewhat uncommonly throughout the tribe. This neurotoxin inflicts full-body paralysis and leaves a victim frozen in whatever position they were in when stung. This paralysis includes the immobilization of all non-autonomic muscles. Muscles within the limbs are affected whereas the heart and lungs are not. Victims retain all sensory capabilities. Another symptom of this venom is nerve pain which comes in pulsations across an individual’s body from the stinger wound. Some individuals also experience auditory, visual, and olfactory hallucination. Together, these afflictions create some of the most harrowing experiences that can be caused by a HiveWing. The effect of most symptoms last for about three days before slowly wearing off. All of these symptoms can be cured by strong stimulants.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h4]Noxious Fumes[/h4]
[p]
HiveWings can also possess the ability to dispense a viscous liquid from around the tip of their tail. This liquid is very adhesive and will stick to any surface, including other dragons. The liquid itself emanates a highly noxious smell, capable of incapacitating an indefinite number of dragons that is determined by an individual HiveWing’s scent range. Those who are able to remain conscious when in the presence of this weapon tend to report feelings of intense nausea, stinging of the eyes, and heightened fear and anxiety. Every HiveWing who possesses this power has a different smelling toxin, however the pungent scent of sulfur and vanilla remains true for a majority of records. This power is non-lethal, although it is highly unpleasant and can be indirectly dangerous as unconsciousness is a rather common symptom of exposure.
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Ecology[/h1]

[h2]Habitat[/h2]
[p]
HiveWings thrive in the grassy savanna of their home continent @[Pantala](location:326aae77-9f26-4124-91ea-e31a4e23a695). They prefer hotter, dryer climates but can do well in temperate environments such as forests. Interestingly, HiveWings can survive in frigid conditions so long as there is little ambient moisture. HiveWings struggle mostly in humidity, regardless of temperature. Tropical zones, such as the @Rainforest(location), and bayou-type places like the @Diamond Delta(location) are examples of places considered inhospitable to most HiveWing colonies, as well as individual HiveWings. Virtually all HiveWings live inside of specially made cells inside of a greater “hive” that houses the entire “colony”. These cells are spacious enough for only one member to live comfortably, however, cells exist side by side and back to back and are more akin to a single room than to an independent living space. HiveWings live in clusters of these cells near blood relatives and have claim over their cells until either death or desertion from the colony.
[/p]

[h2]Diet[/h2]
[p]
HiveWings are true omnivores, benefiting from a vast range of both meat and vegetation. The typical HiveWing diet is a mix of cattle, wild game, grains, nectars, and fruits that are grown, hunted, and foraged for in their home territory. HiveWings tend to prefer fauna over flora, but many HiveWings prefer the sweet tastes of the latter. HiveWings can safely digest virtually all common foodstuffs and are incredibly versatile in this sense. Only carrion and rotted fruits are considered largely unpalatable, with only the most tough and desperate attempting to stomach it. HiveWings take very well to herbal remedies and medicines, with tinctures being particularly popular. HiveWings eat about four meals a day, and starve the fastest out of any tribe. Severe symptoms of starvation begin to manifest after only two days without food, with death occurring after only one week. In addition, HiveWings dehydrate faster than average, with severe symptoms manifesting after only two days without water. Four days is the limit a HiveWing can typically last before succumbing to thirst. Presently, most HiveWing communities participate in husbandry and general agriculture to fill their dietary needs. Some fringe groups living outside of established colonies still choose to hunt and gather. Hunting oftentimes being a mix of ambush and endurance hunting.
[/p]

[h2]Reproduction[/h2]
[p]
HiveWings are an oviparous tribe that reproduces sexually. A female will lay a clutch of unfertilized eggs and a male will fertilize them separately. This also makes HiveWings cyclical egg layers, meaning that they lay eggs routinely, regardless of whether they ever become fertilized. This forces reproduction to follow an established timeframe. This timeframe is unique to each HiveWing, however, oftentimes it is once every two months. Clutches often contain about nine eggs, making them the largest of all dragons on Panthia. Each egg takes about nineteen hours to form. HiveWings often nest in hive-like structures, called nurseries, where each egg is allotted a specific spot where it is secured in place and promptly covered. These nurseries can either be large enough to support an entire community or be constructed by a single HiveWing couple for personal use. Nurseries can be located anywhere that is easily accessible to the parents, or anywhere that can support the weight of larger constructs. HiveWing eggs have very loose requirements for hatching, however, consistency is incredibly important. Temperature, humidity, and even movement variation can be devastating to a developing HiveWing. Eggs take about eight lunar cycles to develop, the lowest of all dragons. Oftentimes, HiveWing eggs are taller, oblong shapes; solid white in color; and are fibrous in texture, feeling as if they are wrapped within thin fibers. 
[/p]

[h2]Lifecycle[/h2]
[p]
HiveWings are born altricial and will not have immediate access to their perceptions for another four days. When a developed HiveWing is born, they eat through their egg shell and instinctively push themselves out where they will remain on the nursery floor until retrieved by a guardian. HiveWing hatchlings are completely helpless by this point and have a yellow-white tint to their scales. This tint lasts for only a few days before normal coloration appears. It takes a newborn HiveWing four days to be able to ambulate and takes eight days for the hatchling to achieve volancy. Additionally, it takes one lunar cycle for a HiveWing dragonet to achieve beginner fluency in the language they are most exposed to. Furthermore, it takes ten days for all abilities to manifest for the first time. Infant HiveWings are considered adolescents when their abilities reach full initial development which is often two lunar years after hatching. All abilities and perceptions grow exponentially with age before plateauing at adulthood which is reached after only five lunar years. All HiveWings suffer from senescence and as such have a maximum life span of one hundred years. The average life expectancy is only a fraction of that at thirty years due only to the highly combative lifestyle that many HiveWings have.

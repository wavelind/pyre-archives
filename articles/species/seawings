If you know what's good for you, IceWing, you'll keep your nose out of the SeaWings' business. You'll be damned if you get in their way. Colder blooded than your like, and they don't stay locked up in their tundra. It's the SeaWings who own the world. It's a SeaWing who runs it. | Unknown, Somewhere by the Razor Reef

[h1]Morphology[/h1]
[h2]Anatomy[/h2]
[row]
[col]
[h3]Height[/h3]
[p]
All SeaWings tend to be rather short with females standing at roughly three and a half meters tall at the shoulder and males standing at an even three meters tall at the shoulder. All SeaWings have the same average wingspan of around eleven meters.
[/p]

[h3]Weight[/h3]
[p]
The average female SeaWing weighs three and a quarter tonnes—three thousand two hundred fifty kilograms—and the average male SeaWing weighs three tonnes or three thousand kilograms.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Speed[/h3]
[p]
The tribe-wide cruising speed is thirty knots in the air and sixty knots in the water. All SeaWings tend to have a maximum speed of forty-five knots in the air and eighty knots in the water.
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Form[/h2]
[p]
Most SeaWings are best described as stout and well-built yet with very smooth and streamlined body shapes. Both males and females share the same general physical traits with the exceptions of their snout shape and sail size. 
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Head[/h3]
[p]
A female SeaWing will generally have a sharper snout; curved horns, which act as extensions of the upper back of her skull; and pointed ears at the back middle of her head. In addition, while all SeaWings have barbels that hang from the front-bottom of their jaw, hers will taper in a way not too dissimilar to the whiskers of a catfish. Along either side of her neck are large platescales that act as covers for gills underneath.
[/p]

[h3]Body[/h3]

[p]
Continuing down her neck from the top of her head are long spines that are connected by a tough membrane. This is often referred to as her “sail” or “fin” and is useful for underwater stabilization. There is also a smaller variant of this sail on the center breast of all SeaWings and it extends to the beginning of the forearms. Patches of glowing scales will form in a dotted line on either of her sides from the very tip of her snout to the very end of her tail. These scales can be illuminated manually or in response to extreme emotion and stress. Her underbelly will be covered by notedly softer scales. Her legs also bear these glowing scales, however, they are concentrated mostly at joints such as the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. It is important to note that these illuminating scales are not clusters of individual scales, but rather a single solid—usually geometric—scale. Lastly, she will have hooked talons with barbs at the end. Her forepaws have webbing between each digit; a trait that also applies to the hindpaws as well. This webbing is the same material as her sail. The most apparent differences between a male SeaWing and his sister would be his snout, which is noticeably shorter with a more curved and rounded end; his sail, which will likely be much longer; and his own pair of barbels which are bulbous at the end, similar to the end of an anglerfish’s lure. In the same vein, his barbels are able to be illuminated, as well.

[col]

[h3]Wings[/h3]
[p]
Like most other Pyrrhians, her wings resemble that of a bat but also bear the same luminescent scales in patterns that are inherited from her mother. There is nothing particularly unique about the wings of the average SeaWing, other than the fact that they are better suited to catching the undersea currents than to catching the overhead air currents.
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Coloration[/h2]
[p]
Female SeaWings have a different color range in comparison to male SeaWings. All SeaWings share a secondary and tertiary color range. The locations of where the colors affect, as listed below, are only the most common occurences. Deviations from these are common, and it is not unlikely that any given SeaWing will have different colors in different places.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Primary[/h3]
[p]
A female SeaWing’s primary color has a range of dark green to light blue. A male SeaWing’s primary color has a range of dark blue to light purple. This affects mostly the traditional scale type present on the back and tail, as well as the head of most SeaWings.
[/p]

[h3]Secondary[/h3]
[p]
A typical SeaWing’s secondary color range will combine the ranges of the two primary, allowing for a much broader range of colors. An individual’s secondary color will never be identical to an individual’s primary color. The secondary color affects the larger platescales found on the neck and underbelly, and also determines the color of the individual’s sail spines.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Tertiary[/h3]
[p]
Typical SeaWing’s tertiary color range is the same as their secondary range. An individual’s tertiary color will never be identical to their secondary, however it can be the same as their primary. Tertiary color primarily affects wing and sail membrane.
[/p]

[h3]Miscellaneous[/h3]
[p]
A SeaWing’s barbel color is dictated by an individual’s primary color, however male bulbs will shine the same as their luminescent scales. All SeaWings’ luminescent scale color range encompasses the entire color spectrum, including white and black. Their talons and horns are white which fades into yellow with age. A SeaWing’s sclera is white, their pupils are black, and their irises are typically cool colors. Warm colored irises are possible, however they are incredibly rare.
[/p]
[/col][/row]
[p]
[h3]Patternation[/h3]
[p]
Hide patternation is uncommon and is reminiscent of oceanic camouflage. Rippling patterns, striations, starbursts, and overall silhouette-breaking patterns have been discovered. The color of these patterns are typically dictated by an individual’s tertiary color, however this is not always accurate.  
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Physiology[/h1]
[h2]Perceptions[/h2]
[p]
All SeaWings share a set of sensory capabilities. The average SeaWing’s tactile sense will be somewhat heightened due to their amphibious origins. They will be able to not only detect small objects that they touch or are touched by, but they can sense pressure changes and movement radially within bodies of water. The strength of this sense diminishes rapidly beyond a radius of more than a few meters. The average SeaWing’s sense of taste is unremarkable with them being able to notice most spices within foods, as well as sweet, bitter, sour, and savory flavors. Something relatively complicated among SeaWings is their eyesight. The average SeaWing has an average visual acuity, however they are also able to see underwater with astounding clarity. SeaWings naturally have air-attenuated eyes and thus are able to see on land without hassle. In order to see underwater, all SeaWings have a pair of natural “goggles” which trap air between the viewer’s eyes and the water around them. This skews underwater vision however this is subconsciously adapted to with little trouble by most SeaWings. In addition, most SeaWings have excellent no-light and low-light vision. Reportedly, SeaWings experience little difficulty in performing the same tasks either in the day or night. However as light decreases, colored vision transitions to a grayscale. This makes performing tasks, such as sorting or arranging, based on color impossible to do efficiently. Image definition remains the same, so all SeaWings are still able to discern objects regardless of light exposure. The average SeaWing has an average sense of smell, being able to estimate scent composition, as well as roughly how long ago the object was at a given location. Lastly, their sense of hearing is also somewhat unique in the sense that SeaWings are able to hear underwater as well as on land. Unfortunately, their terrestrial hearing is greatly reduced, but their aquatic hearing is unmatched by any other tribe, with SeaWings being able to effectively discern source, distance, and even reflections from incredibly far distances. It is important to note that the ability to emit sounds which travel far enough to be heard by other SeaWings from great distances is not universal.

[h2] Universal Abilities [/h2]
[br]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Bioluminescence[/h3]
[p]
Most SeaWings possess scales that can be manually, or automatically, illuminated. A SeaWing is able to light up specific scales or patches of scales with little issue. In addition to this, they will also be able to manually dictate individual scale brightness and luminosity. They cannot control color. This ability is generally unspectacular on its own, but is a cornerstone of both @SeaWing Society(organization) and has a rather wide range of uses for both communication and even culture.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Water Breathing[/h3]
[p]
Through not entirely understood mechanisms, SeaWings are able to properly respire both in open air as well as underwater. Both gills and lungs are present within the typical SeaWing’s body, and nearly all SeaWings report being able to seamlessly shift between the two modes. This shift is generally believed to be autonomic in nature, with most SeaWings claiming that after dragonethood the difference is hardly noticeable. One method is not remarkably more efficient than the other. SeaWings run the greatest risk of dry drowning, and respiratory diseases are very common throughout the Sea Queendom.  
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]

[h2]Limited Abilities[/h2]
[h3]Scaldind SeaWings[/h3]
[p]
SeaWings have a chance of being born with the ability to spit scalding water, similar to a firebreather’s fire. They are able to store water within an internal sack called the “water pocket”. The water in this is brought to a boil within the SeaWing and ejected at very high velocities, much like firebreath. This ability has a maximum range of about four and a half meters and, at point-blank range, the water is roughly one hundred and twenty degrees Celsius which then sharply decreases with time spent out of the body.

[h3]Animus Magic[/h3]
[p]
SeaWings are one of the few tribes that can have dragonets born as Animus dragons, along with @[SandWings](species:04e1f884-1838-432c-8ea6-e76277b0979f), @[SkyWings](species:b1815972-6ede-4bc3-83a4-80b78b78944a), and @[NightWings](species:353bedde-8ebe-4b9f-a934-1bfd2c129bc9). Animus magic is too complex and nuanced a power to be properly explained and described here. Other literature on @[Animus Magic](law:99a5fca8-712a-43d3-b812-b801b8df1caf) will fare much better than this section. Essentially, an Animus dragon is able to perform miracles of sorts. An Animus may entice an inanimate object to move, or imbue some awesome ability to something otherwise inert. This comes at a price, though, as the more magic that an Animus uses, the greater wear on their body and mind. Eventually, overuse will result in the near instant and violent immolation of the user. Fascinatingly, and to the interest of nearly every dragon of power, the enchantments themselves do not revert because of this. An object blessed by the talons of an animus will have its powers persist, should that have been the original will of the enchanter.

[h1]Ecology[/h1]

[h2]Habitat[/h2]
[p]
SeaWings prefer oceanic or otherwise freshwater environments. The @Glittering Ocean(location) is a perfect environment, while coasts, glades, bayous, and riversides are all more than adequate. So long as a SeaWing has access to neck deep water of any variety, they can survive in virtually any location. They are equipped to deal with subzero to scorching climates and can successfully survive and thrive near any part of Pyrrhia’s coast. Living inland is significantly more difficult, and their only biome intolerances include locations where water becomes a commodity. Very few SeaWings live in the @[Frozen Peninsula](location:a66fafa4-df43-4ffb-b962-6881bcf218f4) and even fewer live in the @[Great Desert](location:fbb17d26-6ac4-4a7f-b3ea-4e9f7a88340f). Due to no easy access to fire, only small populations of SeaWings live in the alpine conditions of the @[Taloned Mountains](location:df6cd164-44ef-4d70-aed8-411734f68d0e). However, like @[SandWings](species:04e1f884-1838-432c-8ea6-e76277b0979f), these intolerances are only deterrents. An organized and extremophilic SeaWing could survive in the aforementioned places with enough planning and care. SeaWings tend to live in above water platforms in underwater caves, or in caves with access to neck deep water. Few SeaWings sleep in water, and therefore many try to maintain a dry patch for bedding. They generally live alone and far away from neighbors, with extended family, or in rather large above and underwater communities. 

[/p]

[h2]Diet[/h2]
[p]
SeaWings are meat-leaning, aquatic omnivores. The typical SeaWing’s diet is made up of mostly large saltwater fish, such as tuna and swordfish, as well as undersea flora, such as seaweeds and seagrasses. SeaWings prefer this diet and there is a tribe-wide preference for raw, saltwater foods. The tribe as a whole is also quite adept at opening hard shelled mollusks and crustaceans. SeaWings cannot sustain themselves on a carnivorous or herbivorous diet and a small minority of SeaWings struggle to survive off of the consumption of above-ground flora and fauna. Both often lead to malnutrition and a susceptibility to similar issues. Carrion and other decayed foodstuffs are outright poisonous to most of the tribe. Properly prepared herbal remedies and medicines have rather good effects on many SeaWings. The average SeaWing will eat about three meals per day and starve at an average rate. After only one week with little to no food, most will begin to suffer from the extreme symptoms of starvation. Total starvation often leads to death and happens after about three weeks under the same circumstance. In addition, SeaWings dehydrate remarkably faster than almost any other tribes. Severe symptoms will manifest after only twelve hours of water deprivation and death is near certain after only two days. An important note is that a submerged SeaWing will not need to physically drink water if they are in fresh or brackish water, however, they dehydrate at a fraction of the rate if they are submerged in saltwater. SeaWings acquire food through either organized fisheries, aquaflora cultivation, or hunting local wildlife. SeaWings who hunt are often ambush predators that lie in wait for deepsea prey as well as gatherers who harvest from wild seabed forests. 
[/p]

[h2]Reproduction[/h2]
[p]
SeaWings are an ovuliparous tribe that reproduces sexually. A female will lay unfertilized eggs while a male fertilizes them separately. Unlike many other tribes, SeaWings are cyclical egg layers. This means that female SeaWings have set times where they will lay eggs, regardless of fertilization status. This forces any reproduction to take place during specific  timeframes. These times vary depending on the individual, but often occur once every several months. Clutches tend to be about seven eggs in size. Each egg takes eighteen hours to form. SeaWings often nest in undersea caves or other hard to reach places underwater. These nests will often be set in secluded locations within several kilometers of where the mother lives. SeaWing eggs need to be submerged in warm water in order to properly develop. The eggs will hatch after developing in adequate conditions for about eleven lunar cycles, the fastest out of all the Pyrrhians. SeaWing eggs are oblong in shape; solid blue or green with an oppositely colored swirl; and have a slimy, smooth texture even when out of the water. 
[/p]

[h2]Lifecycle[/h2]
[p]
SeaWings are born precocial and not only have immediate access to their perceptions, but are immediately able to ambulate and swim after hatching. A fully developed SeaWing hatchling will violently push through the egg in a single, vigorous movement similar to a typical saltwater fish. Once hatched, infant SeaWings will stay near their nest for approximately twelve hours. If the hatchling is retrieved by a parent in this time, the responsibility of care falls on the parent and a hatchling will form a paternal connection. If no parent retrieves a hatchling within the proper time frame, the hatchling will strike out on its own to varying success, caring for itself through eating shellfish and mollusks before “graduating” to finned fish. All SeaWing hatchlings are born being able to ambulate proficiently. If a hatchling soon lives on land, it will take about sixteen days for them to learn to fly. A SeaWing will not necessarily learn how to fly during adolescence. It is entirely possible for a SeaWing to never be exposed to an environment conducive to flying, as the “dry environment” necessary for a SeaWing can very easily be an enclosed space. The farther into maturity a SeaWing is, the more the difficulty of learning grows exponentially. SeaWing dragonets will often learn @Aquatic(language) as their first and primary language. It takes approximately one lunar cycle for a SeaWing to gain beginner fluency in the language they are most exposed to. A baby dragonet is born with immediate access to their universal abilities. A scalding SeaWing will be able to spit hot, not boiling, water after only ten days. An infant SeaWing is considered a proper adolescent after one lunar year. Since most SeaWings are born with many abilities, there are no landmarks to signify a SeaWings maturity. All abilities and perceptions grow proportionally to age before plateauing at adulthood. Adolescent SeaWings are considered adults upon reaching sexual maturity which occurs after seven lunar years of life. All SeaWings suffer from senescence and therefore have a maximum lifespan of one-hundred fifty lunar years. Despite this, the average lifespan of a SeaWing is sixty-five years old.

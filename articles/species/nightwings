It is unbecoming of a SandWing, especially one of such high achievement, to even consider our neighbors to the south. Despite this, I can't help but notice that, in our dealings, most of the NightWings had a gleam in their eyes. However misguided that gleam is, there is undoubtedly something there. It is a tragedy that such intellect is wasted on such trivial pursuits. | Sahara Horizons, [i]"Dusk: Memoirs of A Ruler"[/i]

[h1]Morphology[/h1]
[h2]Anatomy[/h2]
[row]
[col]
[h3]Height[/h3]
[p]
NightWings make for an excellent baseline due to their average physique and overall form. Female NightWings stand at roughly four to five meters at their shoulders, and male NightWings stand at about four and a half meters tall at the shoulders. All NightWings share a common wingspan that is around twelve meters.
[/p]

[h3]Weight[/h3]
[p]
A normal, healthy NightWing dragoness tends to weigh roughly two and a half tonnes or two thousand five hundred kilograms. Male NightWings, however, only weigh about two thousand kilograms or two tonnes.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Speed[/h3]
[p]
A male NightWing will tend to be faster in the air, with cruising speeds of around sixty-five knots and a maximum speed of about seventy-five. In contrast, a female will cruise at a brisk sixty knots with maximum speeds of around seventy knots. 
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Form[/h2]
[p]
Both male and females tend to look similar aside from aspects such as height and weight. A typical NightWing will have a well-rounded build with strength and endurance that is about average in comparison to all other Pyrrhians.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Head[/h3]
[p]
Their head is square, however, not as often perfectly geometric as @[MudWings](species:387caa71-4e59-47c6-857f-06bd88c247a0). NightWings will have distinct foreheads between their eyearches. Their snout ends in a keratinous beak and like @[SandWings](species:04e1f884-1838-432c-8ea6-e76277b0979f), they possess a forked tongue. NightWings have straight, cone shaped horns that extend to about their snout length in the opposite direction as the snout. Their ears are usually distinct appendages that angle downwards.
[/p]

[h3]Body[/h3]

[p]
Beginning at the top of the neck are spines that diminish in length as one travels down the centered top of a NightWings back. In comparison to other Pyrrhians, their neck is nondescript aside from its relative thickness, making intensely angled turns difficult to see through. Their back is flat and their wings are an even length from base to farthest tip. The base of the wings separates a NightWing’s harder outerscales from their softer underbelly scales. While the underbelly of an average NightWing has striated marks, they have no functional purpose, and are considered patternation. The fore and hindlimbs of a NightWing have a frontal padding of much harder scales and their talons are short and curled. Lastly, their tail is best described as being the average of most other Pyrrhians
[/p]
[/col]
[col]

[h3]Wings[/h3]
[p]
Like all other Pyrrhians and @[LeafWings](species:26cdc2ff-4485-4c5f-b969-baaa63958009), NightWings possess bat-like wings, with a segmented wing membrane that connects to their body and is divided between five digits on the wing arm. 
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Coloration[/h2]
[p]
All NightWings share a primary, secondary, and tertiary color range. It is important to note that the locations of the aforementioned ranges are only what is most common in the tribe. Deviations from the locations listed below are uncommon, but exist. 
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Primary[/h3]
[p]
A NightWing’s primary color range encompasses dark cool colors along with red. Dark purple, red, green, and blue are all valid candidates for a NightWing’s primary color. Primary color mostly affects their large platescales that line their neck and tougher front-facing scales on their limbs and wing arms.
[/p]

[h3]Secondary[/h3]
[p]
A NightWing’s secondary color range includes all of the colors included in the primary color range. Secondary color and primary color will rarely be the same. Secondary color typically affects the more traditional, softer scales that cover a NightWing’s face and limbs. 
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Tertiary[/h3]
[p]
Tertiary color range is the same as the primary range, however it will be completely different from an individual’s primary and secondary colors affecting the underbelly and their wing arms.
[/p]

[h3]Miscellaneous[/h3]
[p]
NightWing talons and horns are white and begin to yellow with age. Their eyes’ sclera tend to be white, their irises are usually a brighter variant of their primary color, and their pupils are black.
[/p]
[/col][/row]
[p]
[h3]Patternation[/h3]
[p]
All NightWings have the potential to have stripes, starbursts, and uneven streaks on their hides, however they tend to be somewhat rare. These patterns are typically a quaternary color with a range equal to a brighter primary color range. All NightWings also possess uniquely colored wing membranes that are very colorful and explosive in their color and patternation. Typically resembling a clear night sky, NightWings all have unique celestial patterns covering the wing membranes. These patterns are inherited from an individual’s mother and are additive, with new “celestial bodies” being added with every generation. Sometimes these patterns are so intricate and complex that family lineage can be almost accurately mapped by the pseudo night sky under their wings. This phenomenon is so well known that it's almost common practice among many NightWings to try and find common ancestry within each other’s wings.
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Physiology[/h1]
[h2]Perceptions[/h2]
[p]
All NightWings share a set of perceptions. A NightWing’s tactile sense is average, allowing them to feel small objects they touch and are touched by. Their sense of taste is also average, being able to notice most spices within foods, as well as other bitter, sweet, sour, and savory flavors. Their eyesight and visual acuity is about average with the rest of the continent, with clear viewing distances of about seven meters in ideal conditions. Their sense of smell is somewhat unique. Along with the normal ability to discern composition of pungent odors, a typical NightWing can detect rate of decay and state of decomposition. They can also detect diseases within other organisms. Lastly, NightWings have an average auditory sense, being able to estimate distance and source of most sounds. Interestingly, most NightWings have a low-light vision that far exceeds every other tribe except for @[SeaWings](species:0cd789c0-7f2e-47f8-b703-55c4cb51f8bb).
[/p]

[h2] Universal Abilities [/h2]
[br]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Firebreathing[/h3]
[p]
All NightWings can firebreathe at temperatures of eight hundred degrees Celsius. This power is dependent on internal temperature rather than external environmental temperature. All NightWings produce a mucus within their throat and mouth that prevents their own fire from burning themselves. This mucus is worn down with firebreath use and just as natural decay, however it rapidly replenishes and will not wear out with conservative fire usage. After thirty seconds of prolonged firebreathing, however, this mucus will be completely burned away, and a NightWing will risk severely burning their throat and mouth. This is called “overburning” and is often fatal due to burn severity and the difficulty of treating an area such as the throat. There are no known treatments for those who cannot recover on their own.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Shadow Camouflage[/h3]
[p]
NightWings have the unique ability to be totally imperceivable when not directly exposed to light. Both artificial torch-light and natural sunlight are included in this. This extends beyond simply hard to see. Observers cannot hear the sounds, see any part of, or otherwise detect a camouflaged NightWing if the observer is only using their own natural senses. These NightWings will be totally concealed to any living onlooker, but inanimate objects can still detect their presence. This includes tripwires, pressure plates, and any other form of “trigger” that can be tripped by a dragon. A rough rule of thumb is that one’s ability to be perceived is inversely proportional to the amount of light one is exposed to. If there is a faint amount of life reflecting onto a NightWing, then their silhouette will be visible, rather than their entire body.

[h2]Limited Abilities[/h2]
[br]
[row]
[h3]Mind Reading[/h3]
[col]
[h4]Single Moonborn[/h4]
[p]
NightWings born under at least one full moon have a fifty percent chance of becoming a mind reader. This power is somewhat uncommon despite there being schools dedicated to the training and teaching of mind readers. Mind readers are only able to intercept the running thoughts of a target. This interception, to the mind reader, comes almost like an inner-voice speaking in the mind reader’s interpretation of the target’s voice or comes in the form of the images which a target pictures. This ability only affects running thoughts, therefore mind readers cannot “dig” through memories. Untrained mind readers and inattentive mind readers do not need to have a “target” and will simply catch the running thoughts of nearby dragons or other sentient beings. Unfortunately, all single moonborn mind readers suffer from interference which can make discerning and interpreting thoughts markedly more difficult. This has been coined as the Windy Day Effect as it has been described as sometimes being like trying to hear a conversation during a “particularly windy day”. Along with this, another dangerous aspect of mind-reading is the threat of being completely overwhelmed by crowds of sentient beings clamoring for “headspace”. This phenomenon has been called the Fracas Effect due to researchers and subjects describing it as a “fight for who gets heard” which can completely disable and potentially inflict permanent damage upon an incautious mind reader.
[/p]
[h4]Double Moonborn[/h4]
[p]
NightWings born under two full moons are guaranteed both mind-reading as well as prophecy, which is discussed later. These NightWing mind readers have a much stronger form of mind-reading which allows for a clearer interception of a target’s thoughts. dual moonborn mind-reading negates the Windy Day Effect. Along with this, double moonborn mind readers have a much greater effective mind-reading range than their single moonborn counterparts. Effectively rising from around two meters to about six. Lastly, double moonborn mind readers and above can block a prophet’s future-vision, which is reportedly described as being similar to “putting one’s talons over the eyes and ears of a prophet and squeezing”.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h4]Triple Moonborn[/h4]
[p]
As the strongest variant of mind-reading, triple moonborn mind-reading has a few improvements above their bi and mono-moonborn sistren. Firstly, triple moonborn mind readers can read minds through solid materials at one-fourth the range of their line-of-sight range, which is eight meters. All other variants of mind-reading need a clear line-of-sight with the exception of other living organisms which do not count as “solid materials”. Triple moonborn mind readers also have an inherent mind-blocking ability. Reading a triple moonborn’s thoughts is near impossible for anyone other than another triple moonborn, and outright impossible if said triple moonborn is both trained and actively resisting mind reading.
[/p]

[h4]Blood Moonborn[/h4]
[p]
An interesting phenomenon observed within the NightWing tribe is that individuals born under bloodmoons have the enhanced ability of imposing thoughts onto other sentient creatures. This is not a mind-control power, as targets are easily able to ignore a blood-moonborn’s commands. It is, however, more communication based in function. Blood-moonborn NightWings are able to mind read, with the same strength as a mono-moonborn,  and transmit thoughts. This allows for telepathic communication that can only be intercepted by another mind reader. The effective range of this communication is about three meters. Along with this, almost all Blood-moonborns have been described as highly empathetic and able to feel the pain of other sentient creatures. This ability is mutually exclusive with blood moon prophecy, as a dragon cannot have both.
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]

[row]
[h3]Prophecy[/h3]
[col]
[h4]Single Moonborn[/h4]
[p]
Similarly to mind readers, NightWings born under one moon have a fifty percent chance of being gifted with the power of prophecy. At this stage, single moonborn prophets only have vague visions or, on rare occasion, incomplete verbal prophecy. Sometimes, single moonborns are able to give rather comprehensive prophecies, but this is only during times of extremity. Typically, single moonborn prophecy is only a little better than educated guessing. Interestingly, single moonborns have a sort of precognition, and while often not being able to foretell the future of the world, they can often catch glimpses of the next few seconds of their own lives. Single moonborns are the only dragons to have this auxiliary ability.
[/p]

[h4]Double Moonborn[/h4]
[p]
Double moonborn prophets are a significant step up from their single moonborn sistren. These prophets have clearer visions and, while still uncommon, have half-complete or fully complete verbal prophecies. These prophets cannot foretell likely futures, nor can they see the webs of what can happen. The requirements for a double moonborn prophet to receive a prophecy has mostly to do with the likelihood of the future they end up foretelling. If an event is nearly inevitable, a double moonborn prophet will compulsively foretell it. Depending on the vocabulary of the prophet, as well as their academic prowess, a verbal prophecy will be more clear or vague. Interestingly, prophets who are exceptional illustrators have clearer visions. However no prophecy has ever given details that could be used in comprehensive planning, even when a prophet is a high-ranking military officer with the knowledge and experience to properly articulate and plan military action. 
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h4]Triple Moonborn[/h4]
[p]
Triple moonborn prophets are exceptionally powerful seers. They have the same abilities as their bi-moonborn counterparts, however with even heightened clarity in both visions and prophecies. For a triple moonborn, neither vocabulary nor illustrative capacity affects the ability, and verbal prophecies are articulated in a way that is most understandable to the widest audience. How the most efficient words are chosen is unknown. Along with this, most triple moonborns are able to see the vast number of possible futures. The amount of “future” that they are able to see varies between prophets. However, all triple moonborn prophets claim to be able to see at least a handful of potential futures. Interestingly, no triple moonborn is able to directly explain what is going to happen. In what has been named “fortune spoiling”, triple moonborns cannot verbalize, nor record in any way, any of the futures they see. They can, however, take action knowing what a potential future will be. For example, a triple moonborn prophet may foretell that a family member is likely to hurt their wing while flying at a particular time. Said prophet cannot tell anyone that their specific family member is likely going to be hurt, nor can they write it down. However, they can convince the specific family member to stay home for the day.
[/p]

[h4]Blood Moonborn[/h4]
[p]
Like their mindreading counterparts, prophecy also has a blood moon variant. These blood-moonborn prophets have the same prophetic powers as their double moonborn sistren, however blood moonborns are able to view natural and artificial disasters with dizzying clarity. This power is so strong that it rivals triple moonborn prophets, and often exceeds their capabilities. Blood-moonborns are not prevented from “fortune spoiling”, and many famous disasters had their impact lessened by proactive blood moonborns. 
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]

[h3]Animus Magic[/h3]
[p]
NightWings are one of the few tribes that can have dragonets born as Animus dragons, along with @[SandWings](species:04e1f884-1838-432c-8ea6-e76277b0979f), @[SkyWings](species:b1815972-6ede-4bc3-83a4-80b78b78944a), and @[SeaWings](species:0cd789c0-7f2e-47f8-b703-55c4cb51f8bb). Animus magic is too complex and nuanced a power to be properly explained and described here. Other literature on Animus Magic will fare much better than this section. Essentially, an Animus dragon is able to perform miracles of sorts. An Animus may entice an inanimate object to move, or imbue some awesome ability to something otherwise inert. This comes at a price, though, as the more magic that an Animus uses, the greater wear on their body and mind. Eventually, overuse will result in the near instant and violent immolation of the user. Fascinatingly, and to the interest of nearly every dragon of power, the enchantments themselves do not revert because of this. An object blessed by the talons of an animus will have its powers persist, should that have been the original will of the enchanter. 
[/p]
[hr]
[h1]Ecology[/h1]

[h2]Habitat[/h2]
[p]
NightWings prefer temperate climates situated in or near forests. The @Southern Peninsula(location) is an excellent example of the preferred NightWing territory and is where the greatest population of NightWings live. NightWings are adept at surviving in most, if not all environments, with proper planning and organization. The @[Frozen Peninsula](location:a66fafa4-df43-4ffb-b962-6881bcf218f4) and @[Great Desert](location:fbb17d26-6ac4-4a7f-b3ea-4e9f7a88340f) serve as examples of locations where NightWings live with difficulty. NightWings have no inherent biome intolerances. The average NightWing will dig homes into hills or inhabit caves if there are no dragon-made settlements nearby. Typically, these homes will be naturally resistant to inclement weather and are generally resistant. NightWings enjoy a few rooms of space per resident in a home. There are no common limits to how many NightWings will inhabit a single dwelling, so long as there is enough space. Generally, however, NightWings prefer to live with immediate family only. 
[/p]

[h2]Diet[/h2]
[p]
All NightWings are carnivorous. A typical NightWing will have a diet based on large game animals, or livestock depending on location, that is supplemented by small amounts of fish and other miscellaneous meats. Coincidentally, this is the preferred diet of most NightWings barring the addition of sweet-tasting treats that have recently become popular among the tribe. NightWings are able to survive on a traditionally omnivorous, or even carrion based, diet for extended periods of time as long as it is majority meat-based and the individual is willing to exponentially increase the risk of afflictions such as malnutrition and various diseases. NightWings are outright unable to survive more than short times on herbivorous diets, with many plants being considered unpalatable. However, it is important to note that NightWings are able to use herbal remedies such as tinctures and teas, and if properly prepared, can even safely benefit from other forms of medicines. NightWings typically eat two meals per day and will suffer from the symptoms of starvation after only seven days. Total starvation, resulting in death, will occur after about three weeks with little to no food. The average NightWing will feel the severe symptoms of dehydration after only three days with no water. Death is nearly guaranteed for those who attempt to survive for five days under the same circumstances. Lastly, NightWings are stalking predators and utilize their breath weapon and talons to take down prey. When available, NightWings will utilize ranching as an alternative to hunting.
[/p]

[h2]Reproduction[/h2]
[p]
NightWings are an oviparous species and reproduce sexually. A female and male will mate and produce offspring. The average clutch size of a female NightWing is about four. It takes about twenty-four hours for each individual egg to form. The average nesting for many NightWings includes finding, or carving out, a cave in the inside of a hill, mountain, or other hardfaced rock formation. Next, a parent will swaddle the eggs with insulating material, or build a perimeter of the same material to allow for moonbathing. Depending on nesting, parents may use heated rocks to keep the eggs warm. Dry and warm conditions are required for all NightWing eggs. Acquiring moons-blessings requires an open skylight to allow the glow of the moons to fully envelope the egg at any point before six lunar cycles have passed. NightWing eggs hatch after about twelve lunar cycles of development. NightWing eggs are usually oblong in shape, ebony black in color, and rough in texture. Moons-blessed eggs will turn ebony with swirls of white and silver, with the level of coverage dictating, roughly, level of power. For example, a fully white and silver egg implies a triple moonborn will hatch whereas only a single band indicates one variant of single moonborn powers. Eggs bathed in the light of a blood moon turn completely dark red. 
[/p]

[h2]Lifecycle[/h2]
[p]
NightWings are born precocial and have immediate access to their perceptions. When an infant NightWing has reached maturity in the egg, it will use an egg tooth to break through the shell. Once the baby has successfully cracked the egg, it will use its claws to tear away the sides and attempt to exit from the inside of the egg. Once out, the newly hatched dragonet will begin to cry until it feels the warmth of, presumably, its parent or guardian and be soothed. NightWings are born able to ambulate with some difficulty. It will then take twelve days for the baby to develop volancy. Newborn NightWings take about one lunar cycle to achieve beginner, conversational fluency in the language they are most exposed to. All moonblessed NightWings have identical basic development time as their non-moonblessed counterparts. A NightWings universal abilities will manifest after ten days. single moonborn mindreaders will take one lunar cycle to understand the minds of those around them. Single moonborn prophets will also take one lunar cycle to have their powers start to develop. Double moonborn mindreaders will have their abilities manifest after twenty days. Double moonborn prophets will be able to foretell the future after twenty days. Triple moonborn mindreaders are born with immediate access to the ability to understand, if even on a primitive level, the minds of those around them. Triple prophets are born with the immediate, and often overwhelming, ability to see the various future threads. Blood moonborn mindreaders are born with immediate access to their powers. Bloodmoonborn prophets have their abilities manifest after twenty days. A baby NightWing is considered an adolescent after all of their abilities have developed to a beginner level. This often takes about one lunar year. Abilities and perceptions all grow in power with age. All but triple moonblessed NightWings have their powers plateau at sexual maturity. Triple moonblessed NightWings will have their power increase proportionally to age for their entire natural lives. Sexual maturity is reached at seven lunar years of age. This marks a dragonet’s transition from adolescence into adulthood. All NightWings suffer from senescence and have a maximum lifespan of about one-hundred fifty years. The life expectancy of a senior NightWing is about one-hundred years.

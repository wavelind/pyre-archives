While they dutifully tend to our crops and make cordial appearances in our council, it is not uncommon for our ruffians to disappear only to turn up in some unmarked grove.

[h3]Height[/h3]
[p]
All LeafWings share a common size and shape. This puts the tribe as a whole as the tallest on @[Pantala](location:326aae77-9f26-4124-91ea-e31a4e23a695), and the second tallest on @[Pyrrhia](location:5f158d52-c163-4041-94a9-a4162f55853b). LeafWings tend to be six meters tall at the shoulder, which is only half a meter shorter than the tallest @[SkyWings](species:b1815972-6ede-4bc3-83a4-80b78b78944a). LeafWings have a wingspan of fifteen meters, which is also the second largest on @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f).
[/p]

[h3]Weight[/h3]
[p]
All LeafWings have, on average, the same weight that is right about three tonnes, or three thousand kilograms. This makes the tribe heavier than the average Panthian, but only the fourth heaviest tribe on @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f).
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Speed[/h3]
[p]
The average cruising speed of a LeafWing is sixty knots, and the maximum recorded flightspeed was about seventy-five knots. This makes LeafWings faster than the average Panthian, but about the same as the average Pyrrhian. 
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Form[/h2]
[p]
LeafWings have a very balanced build, similar to @[NightWings](species:353bedde-8ebe-4b9f-a934-1bfd2c129bc9). They are not exceptionally bulky or lithe, nor do they possess any abnormal physical features that would heighten their inherent strength, agility, or dexterity.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Head[/h3]
[p]
A typical LeafWing has a rather small head with a medium sized snout. At the end of their snout is a bulbous beak, similar to that of a NightWing. From about the midsection of their snout and running to the very tip of their tail is a ridge of scales. At the eyes, these scales create an overhang and are effectively eyearches for a LeafWing. Their horns are solid and keratinous, but flat and ribbon-like. Extending moderately far past the back of the neck in an upright position. Their ears are long and thin, sitting at the top back of their skull and curving up.
[/p]

[h3]Body[/h3]
On the back of the neck is a large sail, nearly identical to that of a [SeaWing]. This sail extends for the entire length of the body and ends at the tip of the tail. LeafWings have discordantly placed scales, which are almost entirely unique, that appear to be less layered and more clustered together. It is important to note that these scales are still of average size, and are not smaller in comparison to a Pyrrhian or Pantalan. These scales also slightly protrude from the body of the LeafWing, giving them a bumpy texture.  A typical LeafWing’s underbelly is very distinctly different from their back and neck. Instead of having discordantly placed scales, their underbelly is smooth and flat, lacking any real texture. There are markings that segment it, however they are mostly aesthetic and have no physiological purpose. Their forearms and hindlegs are of a moderate thickness and muscle definition. Importantly, they also have two sails for each pair of limbs. One running from the middle of the upper arms to the middle of the forearms and under the elbow. Another running from the middle of the thigh halfway down to the calf and over the knee. Their tail is long and whip-like, however it ends with a large leaf-like paddle at the end.

[/col]
[col]

[h3]Wings[/h3]
[p]
From the neck is the back, and while their back is relatively nondescript, their wings function and appear more Pyrrhian than Pantalan. This means while LeafWings are biwinged, their wings themselves are not batlike; rather their wings bear a closer resemblance to translucent plant leaves.
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Coloration[/h2]
[p]
All LeafWings share a primary, secondary, and tertiary color range. It is important to note that all color locations are the most common locations. That is, many LeafWings do not follow the standards listed here. The location of where these colors are on a given LeafWing is only the most common location. Deviations from what is listed here is not only plausible, but somewhat likely. 
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Primary[/h3]
[p]
A LeafWing’s primary color is almost always green, however the saturation and brightness can vary dramatically, with LeafWings being capable of having near-white or near-black primary colors. This color affects the underbelly, back, and facial scales.
[/p]

[h3]Secondary[/h3]
[p]
A LeafWing's secondary color range is less strict and includes both black and white as well as earthen browns, greens, and even amber oranges. It affects the leathery scales between the more traditional scaletype of the back and underbelly, and the wing arms.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Tertiary[/h3]
[p]
A LeafWing’s tertiary color is usually a darker variant of their primary color, and typically affects the LeafWing’s sail and wing membrane.
[/p]

[h3]Miscellaneous[/h3]
[p]
All LeafWings have white talons, and secondary colored horns. Their eyes have black sclera, black pupils, and warm colored irises. This is shockingly similar to @[SandWings](species:04e1f884-1838-432c-8ea6-e76277b0979f). The reason for this is not well known.
[/p]
[/col][/row]
[p]
[h3]Patternation[/h3]
[p]
All LeafWings share a common range of patternation. This range includes, and is almost exclusive to, hexagonal and generally geometric tessellations across the main body, as well as angled striations. The color of these patterns are identical to an individual’s tertiary color.
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Physiology[/h1]
[h2]Perceptions[/h2]
[p]
All LeafWings have a similar set of sensory abilities. The average LeafWing will have an unremarkable tactile sense, being able to feel small objects that they touch and are touched by. They will have an average sense of taste, being able to notice most spices in foods, along with other bitter, sweet, sour, and savory flavors. Their eyesight, however, is remarkably poor. LeafWings in general have a much lower visual acuity than any other tribe on [Panthia], with all members of the tribe being essentially nearsighted without any kind of corrective lens. Beyond a distance of about one meter, image clarity drops dramatically. To seemingly counter this, the average LeafWing will have a stellar sense of smell, being able to detect traces of scents left by objects days after they were removed. Not only this, but LeafWings are able to accurately determine the composition of smells as well as what they are from. An additional counter to their abysmal eyesight is their absolutely excellent auditory sense. The average LeafWing is able to determine source and distance with astonishing accuracy, as well as even being able to guess the number of reflections with moderate success. In addition, LeafWings are even able to employ a sort of echolocation, being able to entirely forgo the need to see. Finally, LeafWings are able to determine whether an area is hazardous to breathe inside of. Interestingly, this is not the result of some sort of alarm, but rather it is a side effect of a LeafWing’s autonomic shift away from respiring and towards photosynthesizing when breathing conditions render it useless.

[h2] Universal Abilities [/h2]
[br]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Herbaceous Comprehension[/h3]
[p]
All LeafWings demonstrate the unique ability to understand the plant life around them. The effective strength, or clarity, and range of this ability exists on a spectrum. Some LeafWings describe vague feelings of either wellness or illness in regards to local wildlife and others report rudimentary word use within their head describing the condition of the plants. The latter is described as “plant talk” and is communicated universally, meaning that it will always manifest in the best way a receiving LeafWing can comprehend information. For example, one LeafWing may hear plant talk in @[Old Pantalan](language:bc9f2f6a-15b9-40d9-92a0-cd4334b05534)  while another LeafWing may hear the same plant talk in @[New Dragon](language:a0265ef7-3acc-444f-8e4e-7a015f741a14). This plant talk also seems to work as a passive “release” on the part of the plant. Messages are not sent to individual LeafWings, but rather broadcasted to anyone nearby. This means a group of LeafWings will all feel a plant’s condition with varying levels of clarity. There is also no way for a normal LeafWing to communicate directly with a broadcasting plant apart from influencing its surroundings. The strength of this power is passed down generationally and is subtractive, with offspring receiving the “average” of their parents. Rare occurrences happen where a dragonet will be born with a multiplied strength, being the “product” of both parents.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Quasi-Phototrophy[/h3]
[p]
LeafWings have a great reliance on @[Salix](location:b52f3542-9763-4693-9817-3ed7352ecbb7) and its sunlight for survival. LeafWings require sunlight for a number of their biological functions independent of strict energy generation, such as mood regulation and perception stabilization. However, LeafWings also can rely on Salix for their energy generation. The tribe possesses a wholly unique and incredibly efficient method of converting sunlight into energy. This process is similar to photosynthesis found in plants, with the main difference being that LeafWings still need to eat in order to support their phototrophic metabolism. This phototrophy is only fractionally worse than a more traditional metabolism. Amazingly, LeafWings possess both systems and can automatically shift to whichever method is more efficient. This essentially allows LeafWings to forgo the need to breathe entirely if breathing becomes too hazardous and there is adequate sunlight. Due to this aforementioned efficiency in sunlight usage, LeafWings do not need a dedicated suntime like @[RainWings](species:f08d3c96-0981-466c-a92d-814bd79dad72) and, in optimal conditions, can actually remain physically active throughout the day with only marginal energy depletion. The greatest drawback to this phenomenon is that a LeafWing will suffer severely if deprived of sunlight for over a few days. Death can be swift, with the shortest recorded “sunstarved” death occurring in only three days without sunlight exposure. During that time symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, mental fog, and extreme mood shifts will get progressively worse. The general “point-of-no-return” is when a LeafWing begins to have auditory, visual, and olfactory hallucinations.

[/col]
[/row]

[h2]Limited Abilities[/h2]
[h3]Herbaceous Communication[/h3]
[p]
Just as all LeafWings are able to “hear” the nature around them, some LeafWings can “respond” to the nature around them. This ability has been termed “leafspeak” and unlocks a somewhat large range of abilities. First, leafspeak grants the user the ability to directly communicate with plantlife. The exact method of communication is, across the board, described as “sending” a single worded message or mental image and having an equally basic “response” from the target plant. Second, a leafspeak capable LeafWing, henceforth called a “leafspeaker”, is able to encourage a plant to grow at an incredibly accelerated rate. The method in which a leafspeaker is able to do this is not entirely understood, however it is important to note that the target plants will consume the same amount of resources from the soil as if they had grown naturally. For example, both an “encouraged” plant and a “natural” plant will consume the same amount of water and nutrients from the soil they are in. Third, leafspeakers are able to influence the target plant’s final form and shape. For example, having a tree grow into a sort of living bench, or having a plant produce more fruit than normal at the cost of reduced foliage. An important note is that leafspeakers cannot will a plant, or constituent part, into existence, and require at least a seedling. Mushrooms require special study and practice to communicate with.

[hr]
[h1]Ecology[/h1]

[h2]Habitat[/h2]
[p]
LeafWings do best in bright, sunny environments. Their preferred biomes are their home savanna and the @[Poison Jungle](location:f20d622a-1a04-4018-b17d-a7d2edd93fbf), as it provides a good balance between sunlight and available foodstuffs. LeafWings also do particularly well in the @[Great Desert](location:fbb17d26-6ac4-4a7f-b3ea-4e9f7a88340f) as long as there are auxiliary food and water stores. Interestingly, LeafWings are one of the two tribes capable of living underwater for great lengths at a time. LeafWings struggle in cold tundras, such as the @[Frozen Peninsula](location:a66fafa4-df43-4ffb-b962-6881bcf218f4), as well as alpine conditions like the @[Taloned Mountains](location:df6cd164-44ef-4d70-aed8-411734f68d0e) due to temperature. LeafWings tend to live in solitude and prefer home spots with clear and easy access to @[Salix](location:b52f3542-9763-4693-9817-3ed7352ecbb7)’s sunlight. Their typical living quarters consist of raised platforms and houses situated above treelines. Generally, the only accompanying dragons are hatchlings and mates.  
[/p]

[h2]Diet[/h2]
[p]
All LeafWings are phototrophic, but functionally omnivorous as they cannot rely solely on Salix for sustenance. The typical diet of a LeafWing is mostly plant based, with various meat acting as a fill-in for any nutrient that is not easily accessible. LeafWings prefer fruits with distinct flavors, including excessively sweet and bitter. They are able to digest nearly all forms of organic foodstuffs, including fresh carrion. The only intolerance found within the tribe is for severely decomposed carrion and anything non-living. LeafWings take incredibly well to herbal remedies and medicines such as tinctures and teas. LeafWings only require about two meals per month. They starve unbelievably slowly, with symptoms of starvation only beginning to manifest after one month without any food. Total starvation, resulting in a remarkably slow decline towards death, will begin irreversibly in about five weeks, regardless of activity levels. In sharp contrast, LeafWings dehydrate incredibly fast, with severe symptoms of dehydration manifesting in only twelve hours, and death being certain in only two days. LeafWings are instinctively gardeners, so most tend to their own gardens to food. If not, then they gather foods from within the Poison Jungle or benefit from the crops grown in local fields. Water is especially important and nearly all LeafWings prefer locations with easily accessible and plentiful supplies.
[/p]

[h2]Reproduction[/h2]
[p]
LeafWings are oviparous and reproduce sexually. A female and male will mate and produce offspring. The resulting clutch, laid by the mother, is often made up of three eggs. Each egg takes about twenty-seven hours to form. LeafWings often create nests in the ground, burying eggs in specially treated dirt fields. These fields act as the common nesting grounds for entire groups of LeafWings. Parents often live near these nests. Conversely to their hatched counterparts, LeafWing eggs require near total darkness to develop properly. In addition to this, consistent temperature and humidity is required. Eggs take about seventeen lunar cycles to develop properly. LeafWing eggs are oblong in shape, possess a highly reflective and glossy green color, and a smooth texture. Lastly, these eggs have a hexagonal pattern on them that dome outwards in the center of each shape, causing them to have seams and bulbous areas.  
[/p]

[h2]Lifecycle[/h2]
[p]
LeafWings are born altricial and require the care of either a parent or a nanny for the first few days of life. When a LeafWing has fully developed within their buried egg, the egg will begin to deteriorate and the baby dragonet will display an instinctive decision to worm their tail out of the ground towards the surface. The way in which these dragonets know which direction is toward the surface is unknown. The tail of the LeafWing will be similar to the stalk of a plant, with the paddle-like tail appearing to be a leaf. While a dragonet LeafWing waits for a guardian’s retrieval, they will remain dormant and can remain in this dormant state for approximately five days before the infant begins to wither. Upon the tail breaching the surface it will begin to wave with the wind and breezes of the dirt field. When a guardian retrieves an infant LeafWing, they will first grip the tail firmly and pull the baby LeafWing out of the ground similarly to a farmer harvesting a root vegetable. The now exposed infant will let out a high pitched and piercing wail for around half an hour. This is a sign of a healthy dragonet. After this, a baby LeafWing must be left in the sunlight for most hours of the next few days. It will take two days for a baby LeafWing to begin to ambulate and volancy will manifest after only nine days. Baby LeafWings will take about one lunar cycle to achieve beginner, conversational fluency in their most exposed language. All LeafWings are born with their universal abilities partially developed. Leafspeak will take about one lunar cycle to start developing. A LeafWing is considered adolescent after the full beginner development of their universal, limited, and sensory abilities. This often takes about one lunar year. All abilities and senses grow proportionally with age and plateau in power at sexual maturity. An adolescent is considered a sexually mature adult at seven lunar years. Fascinatingly, LeafWings do not suffer from senescence. This means that LeafWings do not deteriorate with biological age, effectively making them immortal. They are still susceptible to harm and can be killed in traditional ways. This means that there is no maximum lifespan for a LeafWing and the oldest recorded LeafWing was over three hundred years old. Despite this, many LeafWings will perish due to disease, combat, or accident by the age of sixty.

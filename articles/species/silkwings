MudWing carpentry is beautiful to the builder, SkyWing strategy is beautiful to the commander, but a SilkWing's art? That is beautiful to the dreamer. It sincerely calls to my soul as a living, breathing, [i]thinking[/i] creature. It is the birdsong of the morning. It is the babble of a hatchling. It is hope that true beauty still exists in this cold world. If I were not Condor, I would like to be a SilkWing. | Queen Condor Passerine, 5112 A.S.[/i]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Height[/h3]
[p]
Nearly all SilkWings stand at the same height of three meters at the shoulder. This makes them the shortest dragons on @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f), along with @[HiveWings](article:484d53ab-b187-48b1-959e-8b168e49237b). Additionally, SilkWings have two pairs of wings and it is important to note that their forewings, the larger pair, tend to be about nine meters across, with hindwings, the smaller pair, being a fraction of their forewing size. 
[/p]

[h3]Weight[/h3]
[p]
Furthermore, the typical SilkWing only weighs about one tonne, or one thousand kilograms. This makes SilkWings not only the smallest, but the lightest of all the tribes as well. 
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Speed[/h3]
[p]
As their wings are closer to more traditional Pyrrhian wings, SilkWings have a hybrid method of flight that serves as a mix between HiveWing quadwing flight and Pyrrhian biwing flight. This results in, among other things, a tribe-wide cruising speed of only thirty knots and a maximum speed of just under forty-five knots.
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Form[/h2]
[p]
All SilkWings tend to have muscular builds and compact bodies, however, they retain a streamlined sleekness, with hardly any visible muscle definition. This makes them somewhat similar to @[SandWings](species:04e1f884-1838-432c-8ea6-e76277b0979f) and nearly opposite to @[MudWings](species:387caa71-4e59-47c6-857f-06bd88c247a0). All SilkWings tend to have very similar characteristics, making it hard to disguish females from males. 
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Head[/h3]
[p]
The average SilkWing will have a rather tall head with a comparatively long and thin snout. Their horns are thin, gently S-curved, and remarkably flexible. Their ears will be at the back of their skull on the top right of either side of their upper jaw. In addition, a SilkWing will possess long, delicate antennae that directly proceed their equally long horns.
[/p]

[h3]Body[/h3]

[p]
SilkWings have a relatively nondescript neck in comparison to other tribes on [Panthia], however there are intermittent spines which run the length of their body beginning from the neck. Their backs also have no particularly unique features. The most unique aspect of most SilkWings is their wing structure. SilkWings have a rather thin waist and underbelly, but possess a rather pronounced ribcage. This extends fairly far past the stomach to the elbows of the forearms. Their fore and hind limbs are relatively thin and have tougher outer scales which face forward from the rest of said limbs and their talons are flat and wide, with long digits and short claws. Lastly, their tail is long and thin and similar to @[RainWings](species:f08d3c96-0981-466c-a92d-814bd79dad72), merely without the prehensile ability.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]

[h3]Wings[/h3]
[p]
As mentioned prior, SilkWings have two pairs of wings that are similar to those found on @[HiveWings](article:484d53ab-b187-48b1-959e-8b168e49237b) as well as butterflies. These wings are classified as two distinct pairs of limbs, with the longer pair of the wings being called their forewings and the shorter pair being called the hindwings. The forewings of a SilkWing have a lot in common with @[LeafWings](species:26cdc2ff-4485-4c5f-b969-baaa63958009) as well as other Pyrrhians. They are segmented with distinct elbow and wing digits and could be accurately described as bat-like were it not for the membrane curve being so soft. Their hindwings are much shorter and wider, being most accurately described as a paddle. There is no segmentation, and the frame connecting to the membranes is comparatively inflexible when contrasted with the forewings. This leads to the forewings being responsible for propulsion as well as lift generation and for the hindwings to be responsible for stabilization and increased aeromaneuverability. SilkWings can flap both pairs of their wings independently of one another. Lastly, It is important to note that in comparison to other biwinged dragons, SilkWings have a much lower wing ratio and medium flap frequency. This makes gliding, as well as any sort of endurance flying, difficult, but allows for greatly increased aeromaneuverability. The wing shoulders mark the transition from harder outer scales to softer underbelly scales.
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Coloration[/h2]
[p]
All SilkWings share a primary, secondary, and tertiary color range. As for the locations of these colors, it is important to note that the locations listed are only the most common. Deviations from what is written below exist, and are often only uncommon rather than impossibly rare. 
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Primary[/h3]
[p]
A SilkWing’s primary color is entirely limitless, from bright reds and oranges to dark blues and greens. This includes both black and white. Primary color affects mostly the harder scales and more traditional scaletype found on the front of limbs, the top of the snout, and on the back, as well as the tail, and the antennae.
[/p]

[h3]Secondary[/h3]
[p]
Secondary color shares a range with primary color, however an individual’s secondary color will never match their primary color. Secondary color affects the underbelly, the wing arms in places lacking tougher scales, and the lower jaw.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Tertiary[/h3]
[p]
Tertiary color has an identical color range to an individual’s primary color and will never match secondary color, but can match primary color. This affects hindwing and forewing membrane, transition scales which separate a SilkWing’s back from their underbelly and the backward facing parts of the limbs.
[/p]

[h3]Miscellaneous[/h3]
[p]
A quaternary color exists on some SilkWings, giving them an iridescent appearance. This quaternary color is typically a brighter or darker variant of the primary, secondary, or tertiary color and affects select areas. SilkWings tend to have primary colored horns and white talons which yellow with age. Their eyes’ sclera is white, their pupils are black, and their irises are unrestricted in possible color.
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]
[p]
[h3]Patternation[/h3]
[p]
As for patterns, SilkWings enjoy symmetrical patterns which have a line of reflection down the center of their back, similar to butterflies. These patterns can be geometric, discordant, or anything in between, however they must be mirrored on both sides of a SilkWing’s body and wings. Pattern color is typically a quinary—or quaternary if none is present—color that has a similarly limitless range like their primary color. This color can match an individual’s primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary colors.
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Physiology[/h1]
[h2]Perceptions[/h2]
[p]
All SilkWings share a set of sensory abilities that are all incredibly heightened by default. Due to this ability to perceive and comprehend an almost unimaginable amount of information, SilkWing perceptions are categorized as a Universal Tribal Ability and have been moved to the appropriate sections.
[/p]

[h2] Universal Abilities [/h2]
[row]
[col]
[h3]Aerodexterity[/h3]
[p]
While not nearly as nimble as @[HiveWings](article:484d53ab-b187-48b1-959e-8b168e49237b), SilkWings maintain a very impressive natural affinity towards aerobatics. By utilizing their quadwing configuration, SilkWings are able to maintain incredible and precise control over rotation and orientation in the air. SilkWings are able to make a three hundred sixty degree turn while stationary, and are able to hover nearly in place. The main downside to their wing setup is that SilkWings are terrible endurance flyers and have a rather pitiful overall flight speed. Along with this, SilkWings will quickly overexert themselves if attempting intense aerobatic maneuvers that other tribes consider well within normal range.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Spatial Sensitivity[/h3]
[p]
All Silk-dominant dragons have a wide range of sensitivities. These sensory abilities far exceed even the most perceptive non-SilkWing. Beginning with tactile sense: SilkWings are able to notice the minute imperfections on surfaces, slight temperature variance between object locations and objects themselves, and can intuitively determine these subtle differences and more with record-setting accuracy. Next is taste with most SilkWings being able to discern a consumable’s ingredient composition and proportion with relative ease. In addition to this, SilkWings are able to notice a much wider range of flavors including the traditional quintet. The average olfactory sense of a SilkWing is also quite remarkable with most being able to not only detect faint scents clearly, but also detect special properties such as composition, rate of decomposition, the presence of disease, and even discern individuals accurately. Not only this but SilkWings are able to accurately estimate where and when an object was within a room where the target object has been removed. The set record for this ability’s power was accurate judgment fourteen days post-removal. SilkWing eyesight, while the arguably weakest base sense, is still rather refined. Their visual acuity is about one hundred meters, which is still significantly higher than most other tribes. Lastly, the average SilkWing auditory sense allows them to discern distance; pinpoint location; and, in many cases determine, the number of auditory reflections. While all base senses have been covered, SilkWings also possess two unique senses: barometric and vibrational sensitivity. SilkWings can detect incoming storms and altitude, as well as vibrations through a fair number of mediums not limited to air and rock. Finally, SilkWings have exceptional proprioception and many can not only detect their own limbs within space, but additional objects such as held items and harness-like apparati. The main drawback to this wide range of powers is the very real risk of sensory overload which is a very common and well-known issue. It can often be severe enough to cause a careless SilkWing to suddenly go unconscious.
[/p]

[h3]Silk Spinners[/h3]
[p]
SilkWings possess the unique ability to produce a silk-like material, referred to as simply “silk” or “normal-silk”, from the base of their wrists. Aesthetically, silk is very similar to spider thread in appearance; it has a moist, sticky texture when first produced and becomes dry and chalky after about six hours of air exposure; and it lacks a distinguishable taste. Functionally, silk has a remarkably high tensile strength, comparable to some metals and is quite resistant to things such as elemental exposure and cutting or slicing. The average SilkWing can produce about half of a kilometer of silk before it becomes painful and dangerous to produce. It is believed that silk production and quality is directly related to diet, with a more balanced diet producing stronger silk and in greater quantity. Silk is usually an off-white color and is tinted the same as the producer’s secondary coloration.  
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]

[h2]Limited Abilities[/h2]
[h3]Flamesilk[/h3]
[p]
While most SilkWings can produce normal-silk, a small minority of SilkWings are able to produce a variety of silk with different properties. These SilkWings are collectively called “flamesilks”. Flamesilks can have a wide variety of silk types called “variants” and each variant has its own special attributes. Typically, a flamesilk will have about three different variants called their “silkset” in addition to normal-silk. A flamesilk is able to subconsciously choose which silk from their silkset to produce and it will be spun in a process nearly identical to a non-flamesilk SilkWing. Variants are affected by tribal heritage, parents, random chance, and the other variants a flamesilk has. An incredibly common variant is “flame-silk. Flame-silk is best identified by its fiery aspects and, to non-SilkWings, it is often thought of as the tribe’s breath weapon. When produced by an able flamesilk, this variant will ignite combustible materials, melt some metals, and radiate a great deal of heat. Recorded contact temperatures of most flame-silks are about seven hundred degrees Celsius. Interestingly, most flamesilks are unaffected by their own flame-silk and can handle it without any risk. In addition to this, they cannot feel the radiant heat of their own silk. Other common variants include: “Glow-silk”, which glows a bright shade of the flamesilk’s tertiary color; “Tough-silk”, which looks like normal silk and possesses additional strength making it nearly unbreakable under all but the most extreme stresses found on [Panthia]; and “frost-silk”, found commonly on Silk-Ice hybrids, which freezes objects it comes into contact with and turns most metals brittle after only seconds of contact. Flamesilk powers are hereditary and can only be passed down by a parent. There is no power range which means that all flamesilks have equally strong ability. Lastly, many flamesilks have a similar silkset, making completely unique variants improbable but not impossible.

[col]
[h3]Hypnotic Mesmerization[/h3]
[p]
A small population of SilkWings possess the unique ability to hypnotize other living creatures. These SilkWings are commonly referred to as “hypnotist SilkWings” or simply “hypnotists”. In order for a SilkWing to use their power they must focus on a target creature and have said target return eye contact. Once this condition is satisfied, the process known as the staging period will begin. The staging period determines how long a target will be affected by a hypnotist’s influence. The duration of this influence is called the action period. A hypnotist’s staging period will last until either dragon’s sightline is broken. This phase is so sensitive that even blinking is able to disrupt it, however, a target will feel compelled to both not blink as well as maintain eye contact. Contrastingly, a hypnotist will not feel any compulsion. For every ten seconds the staging period lasts, the action period will last for ten minutes to a maximum of two hours. The action period begins immediately proceeding the staging period and is the phase where a properly “staged” individual actually becomes hypnotized. This hypnotization causes the afflicted to enter a relaxed, suggestible state. Former targets report feelings of ease and a very strong mental fog. The hypnotist is now able to easily direct and command their target verbally. Any dragon is able to command a target, however, a hypnotist’s command will be more effective and override prior commands. A hypnotist is even able to force a target’s memory to clear for the duration of the action period. Records show that even when a target is physically harmed this spell is not broken. There are currently no known methods of breaking a hypnotist’s spell, however, without any commands a target will not act. This would allow a target to safely recover with little difficulty if they are removed from a situation where a command may be given. Reports indicate that a target will not feel distress if they are unable to complete a given task, however, they will continue attempting to fulfill the request even if physically restrained until either a new command is issued or the action period ends. This power also exhibits a number of interesting quirks. The staging period is much more effective if a hypnotist’s wings are fully visible and splayed, increasing the staging rate of ten minutes per ten seconds to thirty minutes per ten seconds. Former targets report that a hypnotist’s wing patterns appear to oscillate during this. A caveat to the power is its inability to affect blind individuals, regardless of whether it is congenital blindness or not. Another caveat is that individuals who are aware of what a hypnotist is doing immediately prior to a hypnotist staging them are much more likely to be able to resist the compulsion to maintain eye contact. This also appears to hold true for abnormally strong willed individuals as well. Lastly, a hypnotist can stage multiple targets at once due to the power affecting anything that observes a staging hypnotist. This is not to be confused with initiating the staging process. Due to a hypnotist only being able to focus on one target at a time, the strength and efficacy of the staging period will diminish radially from the primary target, with those closest to the primary target being the most extraneously affected.

[h1]Ecology[/h1]

[h2]Habitat[/h2]
[p]
SilkWings prefer warm, dry climates and environments and many consider the tribe’s home savanna to be perfect. Most SilkWings are also able to tolerate most environments on @[Panthia](location:8855bd4a-8ff2-4379-b837-a44314eb7b0f). They are quite versatile in terms of biome survivability and there are no locations, save for the polar regions of the @[Frozen Peninsula](location:a66fafa4-df43-4ffb-b962-6881bcf218f4) and the hottest strips of the @[Great Desert](location:fbb17d26-6ac4-4a7f-b3ea-4e9f7a88340f), that a SilkWing cannot survive and thrive in. The SilkWing tribe’s only real intolerances are towards the most extreme of conditions. SilkWing housing often consists of intricately weaved and constructed nesting made by a single, or family, of SilkWings. Generally, most SilkWings live in large communities of other SilkWings, with family and close friends sharing a single nest home.
[/p]

[h2]Diet[/h2]
[p]
SilkWings are generalist herbivores with their average diet being a combination of nutritiously limited, such as grasses and leaves, and bountiful, such as fruits and fruitlike parts, vegetation. SilkWings tend to prefer the latter, with fruits and vegetables fitting under culinary definition being especially popular. SilkWings struggle to digest much else, however, many are able to temporarily stave off hunger through the consumption of cooked meat, though this can lead to many of its own problems. Generally, SilkWings are completely intolerant to meats as well as carrion. SilkWings take very well to herbal medicines such as tinctures and other remedies. They also typically eat four meals per day or will graze numerous times, up to five, throughout the day. Just as well, SilkWings tend to starve moderately faster than average, with severe symptoms manifesting after around one week with little to no food. Total starvation, often resulting in death, takes two weeks. In addition, SilkWings dehydrate slower than average, with severe symptoms of dehydration occurring after four days without water and death being certain after eight. Most SilkWings in the present day cultivate their own food or benefit from efforts of the @[HiveWings](article:484d53ab-b187-48b1-959e-8b168e49237b). A small population of SilkWings still rely on the fertile outskirts of the @[Poison Jungle](location:f20d622a-1a04-4018-b17d-a7d2edd93fbf) to produce fruits for harvesting. Most, if not all, SilkWings graze in fields wherever convenient.
[/p]

[h2]Reproduction[/h2]
[p]
SilkWings are an oviparous tribe that reproduces sexually. A female and male will mate and produce offspring. The resulting clutch, laid by the mother, often contains only three eggs. Each egg takes about twenty-four hours to form. SilkWings nest in weaved hammocks, specially crafted to securely hold any eggs laid. Eggs are often swaddled in silk. Nest hammocks are usually within the home of the parents but can also be outside of the home in a nearby location. SilkWing eggs require warm, dry conditions to properly develop. Development takes about eleven lunar cycles. SilkWing eggs are tall and oblong in shape, solid grey with white striations in color, and smooth in texture.
[/p]

[h2]Lifecycle[/h2]
[p]
SilkWings are born altricial with immediate access to a basic level of their perceptions. Upon fully developing within the egg, SilkWing hatchlings will claw at the softer shell of their egg and tear themselves free. After hatching and presumably in a nest hammock, the newborn will remain there and make quiet humming vocalizations until a parent comes and retrieves them. It takes two days for a Silk hatchling to begin to ambulate. SilkWing dragonets are born without wings and instead have wing buds that appear to be sizable bumps where an adult’s wings would be. However, once wings have developed it takes a SilkWing around six days to achieve volancy. It takes about one lunar cycle for a baby SilkWing to achieve a basic level of fluency in the language they are most exposed to. All typical SilkWings will experience Metamorphosis sometime within their childhood. Usually, Metamorphosis takes place between the fifth and sixth year of life. It takes about ten days for an infant SilkWing to gain access to their universal abilities. Flamesilk powers do not manifest until after Metamorphosis. The same is true for Hypnotist SilkWings. A baby SilkWing is considered an adolescent after the initial development of all universal abilities which is usually after about one lunar year. All abilities and perceptions grow proportionally with age until Metamorphosis, at which point there is an exponential jump in quality of abilities and perceptions. A SilkWing will transition from adolescent into adult one year after Metamorphosis takes place. This is often at seven lunar years of life. SilkWings suffer from senescence and as such have a maximum life span of one hundred years. Despite this, the average life expectancy of a SilkWing is about sixty years due to the dangers of @[Pantala](location:326aae77-9f26-4124-91ea-e31a4e23a695).

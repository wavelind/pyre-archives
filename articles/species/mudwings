Built like a fortress and fired like its bricks, MudWings are the greatest work horses of our era. Whatever they lack in etiquette, they have in hospitality. Whatever loss there is of dexterity is countered by strength.

[h2]Anatomy[/h2]
[row]
[col]
[h3]Height[/h3]
[p]
Female and male MudWings share an average height. A healthy MudWing dragoness will stand at a remarkable five and a half meters tall at their shoulder. This makes the tribe the third tallest on Panthia, just behind @[LeafWings](species:26cdc2ff-4485-4c5f-b969-baaa63958009) and @[SkyWings](species:b1815972-6ede-4bc3-83a4-80b78b78944a) respectively. Additionally, both sexes share an average wingspan of thirteen meters, once again placing MudWings in third among all other Panthians, once again behind the previous two. 
[/p]

[h3]Weight[/h3]
[p]
MudWings are the heaviest tribe on both @[Pyrrhia](location:5f158d52-c163-4041-94a9-a4162f55853b) and @[Pantala](location:326aae77-9f26-4124-91ea-e31a4e23a695). This is due mostly to their incredibly durable platescales, impressive wingspan, towering height, and the dazzling musculature and physique required to move these behemoths. MudWings tend to weigh four tonnes, or four thousand kilograms. This makes the tribe as a whole almost five hundred to one thousand kilograms heavier than the contender for second place, the @[SkyWings](species:b1815972-6ede-4bc3-83a4-80b78b78944a).
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Speed[/h3]
[p]
Perhaps unsurprisingly, MudWings are some of the slowest flyers on Panthia. They just barely fall below the global average of forty-seven knots with both female and males averaging about forty-five knot cruising speeds. The fastest recorded MudWing was able to reach a speed of fifty-five knots. This is only faster than the SeaWings, who can fly at a sluggish thirty knots, and the RainWings who are only capable of gliding at about fifteen knots.
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Form[/h2]
[p]
All MudWings share a similar physique and build. Most MudWings are best defined as boxy and heavyset, with incredibly solid frames and excellent stability due to their lower center of gravity. Indisputably the strongest tribe on the planet, MudWings have an evenly distributed strength that allows them to achieve remarkable athletic feats. Unconfirmed reports say that many MudWings are able to push and pull objects almost double or triple their own weight, and fly with cargo that far exceeds the weight of what almost every other dragon can carry. Both sexes share a similar overall shape and form, with only a few significant differences being noted during the research for this document. Further descriptions represent only the general population of MudWings, and no two MudWings are the same. 
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Head[/h3]
[p]
The average MudWing dragoness has a very flat and square snout and head. Her nostrils sit at the top of her snout, similarly to those found on an alligator. Additionally, she has very distinct top facial scales that overhang to create a pair of eyearches. Her horns curve into a downward spiral, similar to that of a ram and her ears are positioned at the top back of either side of the upper jaw. Beginning from the very tip of her snout and running all the way to the tip of her tail are platescales that are extremely durable and often cited as being almost wholly resilient to piercing blows and even immolation. From the back of her neck to her tail are spines that also share a similarity with most crocodilians. For comparison, a male MudWing's only differences include having a generally shorter snout and having horns that curl out and forward, similarly to horns found on bulls.
[/p]

[h3]Body[/h3]

[p]
Her anatomical underbelly reaches farther up her sides than other Pyrrhains, with her top most platescales directly transitioning to the softer underbelly scaletype rather than to an intermediary. Her fore and hind limbs are almost entirely covered in the aforementioned intermediate scaletype. These scales are not very protective and are more akin to leather than proper scales. Her talons are flat-bottomed and wedgelike. Lastly, her tail is flat and wide and thick enough to even serve as a natural blunt weapon.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Wings[/h3]

[p]
Her wings are bat-like, being two limbs with leathery membranes connecting each digit. However, one aspect of her wings are uncommon among other Pyrrhians and LeafWings. That aspect is lack of connection between the wings' membranes and the sides of her body. This gives her much greater range of movement with her shoulders mid flight and, by extension, her wings. Fascinatingly, this affects her flight and even offers benefits in aerodynamics. The drawback being overall flight performance is hindered as gliding is more difficult and generating enough lift to sustain flight generally requires more energy. Her wing arms lack platescales, however, the area around the base of her wing shoulders are covered.
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Coloration[/h2]
[p]
Unlike most other aspects of the MudWings' physiology, there are no sexual differences in coloration or patternation. Both male and female MudWings share a primary, secondary, and tertiary color range. Additionally, both male and female MudWings share the same pool of patterns. It should be noted that the given locations of where these colors affect are only what is most common among members of the tribe. Deviations from these assertions are not only possible, but entirely likely
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Primary[/h3]
[p]
A MudWing’s primary colors consist of almost exclusively browns, oranges, and reds and affect the large platescales found on their head, back, and tail. 
[/p]

[h3]Secondary[/h3]
[p]
A MudWing’s secondary range is the same as their primary range. An individual MudWing’s primary and secondary colors will never be the same. Secondary color affects the more traditional scaletype sandwiched between their leathery underbelly and their back platescales. It also affects the wing arm color as well as the limb colors. 
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Tertiary[/h3]
[p]
Tertiary color has the same range as both primary and secondary. A MudWing’s tertiary color will never be the same as their primary, but can be the same as their secondary. Tertiary color primarily affects the lower jaw, wing membranes, chest, and underbelly. 
[/p]

[h3]Miscellaneous[/h3]
[p]
A MudWing’s talons are white and yellow with age which is the same as their horns. Their eyes’ sclera are white, their irises are often amber, and their pupils are black. 
[/p]
[/col][/row]
[p]
[h3]Patternation[/h3]
[p]
Interestingly, their patternation is incredibly varied and diverse, with distinct patterns ranging from geometric to discordant, tesselating to single instance, and much more. All recorded MudWings have a pattern and this pattern is so distinct that it is enough to distinguish not only family ties, but individuality as well. Entire groups of MudWings can potentially have their relations with one another discerned through patterns alone. These patterns are often warm colors, however it is entirely possible for them to have cool colored patterns as well. This is even possibly in direct, clashing contrast with the rest of their colors.
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Physiology[/h1]
[h2]Perceptions[/h2]
[p]
All MudWings share a set of sensory abilities. The average MudWing has a remarkably poor tactile sense with it being common for MudWings to not feel small objects they touch, are touched by, or even pierced by. Their sense of taste is average, with them being able 	to notice most spices in foods, as well as bitter, sweet, sour, and savory flavors. Their eyesight is average with MudWings having a modest visual acuity and having the ability to see things from a moderate distance. Their sense of smell is also not very remarkable, as most MudWings are able to detect scent composition, as well as estimate when an object left a given location. Lastly, MudWings have an average auditory sense, being able to estimate distance and source of most sounds that they are able to hear.
[/p]

[h2] Universal Abilities [/h2]
[br]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Variable Firebreath[/h3]
[p]
All MudWings are able to breathe fire with a temperature of one thousand degrees Celsius in conducive conditions. Unfortunately, this power is dependent on a MudWing’s external environment and cold climates will affect, if not outright nullify, the MudWing’s ability to firebreathe. All MudWings produce a mucus that lines their throat and mouth that prevents themselves from being burned by their own fire. This mucus can be worn down and constantly replenishes. After about thirty seconds of sustained firebreathing, this protective layer will have fully burned away and prolonged use will cause severe and often irreparable damage to the users throat and mouth. This is called “overburning” and in most cases is fatal. This is due to the difficulty of treating such severe burns within the affected area. There are no known treatments to aid those who cannot recover on their own.
[/p]

[h3]Sibling Solidarity[/h3]
[p]
Many MudWings feel an innate and inherent sense of cohesion and loyalty towards dragons, MudWing or not, that hatched within their own clutch. This quirk, known as clutch-bonding, manifests independently of location or culture. In addition, there are a number of anomalous attributes to clutch-bonding that give credit to its designation as a uniquely MudWing ability instead of a widespread, draconic trait. For one, it is marked by a strong, often described as overpowering, desire to protect clutchmates from physical harm. This occurs even among siblings who describe themselves as despising the other. Second, many MudWings report being able to feel the emotions of their siblings in an empathic way. This includes basic emotions as well as pain. Studies show that two MudWing siblings will feel the other’s emotions even when in rooms separated by solid rock. Additionally, no range has been found, with clutch-bonded MudWings able to detect distinct sibling emotions from up to one hundred miles away. Lastly, clutch-bonded MudWings are able to pseudo communicate with other clutch-bonded MudWings. This communication is never specific words or phrases, reported as being vague but understandable impulses or instincts. Attempts to recreate this have failed, and many MudWings swear by it being how their clutch survived on their own.

[/col]

[col]
[h3]Clay Comfort[/h3]
[p]
For reasons not entirely understood, various types of clays, muds, and soils will have very medicinally beneficial effects on MudWings when applied topically to wounds and other injuries. This effect manifests independent of the soil’s composition, and identical samples will not affect non-MudWings in the same way. Within the MudWing tribe, this “clay comfort” can be used to treat a wide variety of physical afflictions from aches and pains to burns to very traumatic injuries sustained after intense bouts of combat. Treatment can be broadly described as rapid healing, pain alleviation, infection deterrence, and more. In addition to this, many MudWings report feeling invigorated, more alert, and as if they have greater mental clarity when exposed to mud either through bathing or simply manipulating globs of it in their talons. There is no way to quantify the latter effects, however, it is important to note that these benefits are so adamantly believed that they have rooted themselves firmly as fact in an otherwise pragmatic society.
[/p]

[h3]Efficient Respiration[/h3]
[p]
MudWings have a rather excellent respiratory system that allows them to hold their breath for hours at a time while stationary, and up to an hour while still active. Not only this, but MudWings are able to breathe thinner, contaminated, or otherwise hazardous air with little to no adverse consequence.
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]

[h2]Limited Abilities[/h2]
[row]
[col]
[h3]Seismic Attunement[/h3]
[p]
A rare and peculiar power among the MudWing tribe is the awesome ability to manipulate the ground beneath their feet. MudWings who are able to do this are called “seismoscales” due to the power’s perceived resemblance to earthquakes. This power works by allowing a seismoscale to exert massive amounts of force on a section of earth that they are in direct contact with. This means that seismoscales are able to raise and lower large swathes of earth and rock as long as that rock is either being directly contacted by a seismoscale or in contact with something that a seismoscale is directly contacting. The best example of this is a boulder that is resting on the ground. A Seismoscale could manipulate both the ground the boulder is on, as well as the boulder itself. However, if the boulder is in the air a seismoscale cannot manipulate it. In addition, if another stone were atop the first boulder, a seismoscale could not manipulate the new stone either. It is important to note that Seismoscales cannot create earth and simply manipulate existing material. Seismoscales leave holes underground when raising the ground due to the moving of the earth. These acts also have a physical toll on the individual seismoscale. Seismoscales risk death if the attempted amount of earth moved exceeds their capabilities. Seismoscales cannot move mountains and, after prolonged use, seismoscales will become too physically exhausted to continue utilization of their power. The few recorded instances of MudWing seismoscales have yielded a fair amount of potential use cases. Seismoscales have raised defensive walls out of the rock around them and there are a number of peculiar rock bridges that have no natural explanation. Skeletal remains found within rock formations at the site of some famous battlefields indicate seismoscale offense. Lastly, some locations found on Pyrrhia point to seismoscale sculptors potentially using the continent itself as their canvas. 
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Bloodmarking[/h3]
[p]
Some MudWings are born “bloodmarked”. Bloodmarked MudWings benefit from a fair number of new abilities and traits. First, all bloodmarked MudWings are resistant to fire and subsequent burns. This allows them to hold and handle blazingly hot materials and, depending on the individual, pain from immediate burns ranges from only a warm sensation to mild discomfort. This only affects the top most layer of scales, meaning MudWings can still have their throat, mouth, and other internals burned with relative ease. Second, bloodmarked MudWings starve slower, being able to go extended periods of time without eating or drinking. Third, bloodmarked MudWings are wholly resistant to disease, however they can still be physically injured as well as die. Lastly, bloodmarked MudWings possess an active ability, colloquially called “bloodrent”, that triggers when a bloodmarked MudWing consumes the blood of another dragon or their own. This ability grants the user heightened senses, strength, agility, and overall speed. However, this is at the cost of cognitive faculties, as a “bloodrent” MudWing will enter a frenzy. This makes them highly aggressive and unable to distinguish ally from enemy. The term “bloodrent” comes from the high number of cases where a MudWing has betrayed friends, allies, and even siblings without conscious thought.
[/p]

[h3]Elder Aptitude[/h3]
[p]
A phenomenon that exists within the MudWing tribe is the predisposition of a clutch’s first hatched to be markedly stronger, faster, and overall more physically capable and perceptive than their siblings. This is regardless of biological sex and it affects all MudWings proportionally. These “oldest siblings” have been colloquially named “BigWings”, and generally serve as the de facto leader of a given group of siblings. BigWings have also been found in clutches of mixed eggs. Essentially, all clutches of eggs are guaranteed a BigWings so long as at least one egg is MudWing. The mechanism for how this works is currently unknown.

[hr]
[h1]Ecology[/h1]

[h2]Habitat[/h2]
[p]
MudWings prefer environments plentiful in wet mud or clays. Things like swamps, such as those around the perimeter of the @Diamond Delta(location); marshes, such as the delta itself; and numerous other coastal areas act as ideal MudWing territories. MudWings can survive in virtually every environment with tangible success. Even arctic regions such as the @[Frozen Peninsula](location:a66fafa4-df43-4ffb-b962-6881bcf218f4) have historically had small MudWing populations. MudWings do not possess any biome intolerance, save for the most destroyed and inhospitable wastelands. MudWings live very close together and prefer housing with siblings. However, incredible amounts of space is needed when two or more groups of unrelated siblings share the same immediate community. MudWing lodging is more akin to a barracks with it being a single common room with bedding for each member. 
[/p]

[h2]Diet[/h2]
[p]
MudWings are meat-leaning omnivores. The average diet of a MudWing consists of mostly fibrous plants and grasses, waterfowl, and crocodilians that inhabit the [Diamond Delta]. Coincidentally, this is also the preferred diet of most MudWings. MudWings are able to substitute most meats with any other game, such as deer, or domesticated cattle and, interestingly, MudWings do not need protein rich diets to maintain their excellent physiques. MudWings are very versatile in terms of what they can survive on, being able to sustain themselves on any source friendly towards heterotrophs. They cannot, however, survive long-term on strictly carnivorous, or herbivorous, diets. In addition, they are unable to digest carrion, regardless of its relative freshness. MudWings take very well to medicinal remedies such as tinctures and teas. The average MudWing consumes about three meals per day, with the symptoms of starvation manifesting after only one week with little to no food. Total starvation and death occurs after about four weeks. MudWings also dehydrate at an average rate, with symptoms manifesting after only three days. Most MudWings will become terminally dehydrated after about one week without water. Finally, most MudWings will ambush and hunt within the glades and swamps they tend to live in. If living in a more plains-like environment, they will either raise cattle or hunt using nearby freshwater.
[/p]

[h2]Reproduction[/h2]
[p]
MudWings, like most other Pyrrhians, are an oviparous species that reproduce sexually. A female and male MudWing will mate in order to produce offspring. Clutch sizes for MudWings tend to be larger than average, with a common count being five and up to seven or eight being uncommon. It takes about twenty-six hours for each egg to form and be subsequently laid by the mother. The average nesting for most MudWings consists of constructing a sturdy mudbrick shed then placing all of the eggs within the clutch inside. Finally, the parent will seal the entrance in such a way as to allow for the eventual BigWings inside to break free. These sheds are usually close to the mother’s home, but far enough away as to allow the group of siblings to claim the surrounding area as their own. MudWing eggs require cool, partially dry conditions to incubate. Eggs hatch after about thirteen lunar cycles, the longest of any tribe, of development. MudWing eggs are oblong, brown or amber in color, and have a smooth texture. Bloodmarked eggs are laid appearing normal and then shift their color to a dark maroon after about seven lunar cycles.
[/p]

[h2]Lifecycle[/h2]
[p]
MudWings are born precocial and have immediate access to their perceptions. The first MudWing to hatch will always exhibit the BigWings phenomenon. They are also the only MudWing able to break out of their own egg, as their siblings will not hatch on their own. The BigWings of the clutch, after independently hatching, will proceed to break the shell of all other eggs in the clutch in attempts to hatch the dragonet inside. Once all eggs within the clutch are broken, regardless of the occupant’s survival, all remaining siblings will begin trying to break free from their nest until encountering either sunlight or moonlight. All MudWings are fully ambulatory immediately after hatching, but are volant after fourteen days. The manifestation of basic linguistic ability can vary wildly among MudWing dragonets for a variety of factors. Despite this, records indicate that on average it takes a baby MudWing about fifteen days to develop conversational fluency in any language they are most often exposed to. MudWing dragonets will develop their universal abilities after about ten days. This includes powers such as fire breathing and soil healing. Limited powers will develop in varying times depending on the ability itself. Seismoscale dragonets will be able to shift small amounts of earth in fourteen days; bloodmarked dragonets will gain the power’s passive abilities immediately after hatching, but can only become bloodrent after ten days; and BigWing powers manifest prior to hatching. MudWing infancy lasts until the full fundamental development of all abilities and perceptions. This often takes about one lunar year from hatching, after which MudWings will be considered proper adolescents. All perceptions and abilities grow stronger, proportionally, with age. Adolescence lasts from one lunar year to six lunar years, with sexual maturity at age six marking the leap into adulthood. All MudWings suffer from senescence and have a maximum lifespan of one hundred fifty lunar years. The average MudWing has a lifespan of about sixty years.

IceWings stand as examples of the diversity of Panthian dragons. They function so unlike their sister tribes yet, beyond the biological level, act almost the same. It is not hard to understand the motives and desires of an IceWing. It is not impossible to know their dreams and fears. They are so like us, yet so very different, that I believe it challenges our very notion of "dragon" and what those are. | Dreamwalker Solstice, [i]"Musings of a Poet"[/i]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Height[/h3]
[p]
Female IceWings are taller than the average dragon, standing at four and three-quarters meters tall at the shoulder. Male IceWings are just a little shorter than average, standing at an even four meters tall at the shoulder. Females tend to have wingspans of about twelve meters, and males tend to have wingspans of about twelve and a half meters.
[/p]

[h3]Weight[/h3]
[p]
Female IceWings tend to weigh about two and three-quarters tonnes, or two thousand seven hundred fifty kilograms, and males tend to weigh about two and a half tonnes, two thousand five hundred kilograms.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Speed[/h3]
[p]
Female IceWings have an average cruising speed of sixty knots with a maximum of seventy knots. Male IceWings have an average cruising speed of sixty-five knots with a maximum of seventy-five knots. 
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Form[/h2]
[p]
All IceWings tend to have a similar build, however females tend to be larger and stronger than their brothers. Depending on environmental conditions and personal preference, they can either be very bulky and heavyset, or lithe and agile. This is mostly due to their layers of “glacial scales” and is further expanded upon in the abilities portion of this document.
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Head[/h3]
[p]
A female IceWing’s head is square yet with a distinct forehead. Her snout is short and compact with pronounced nostrils that flare out in either direction. The front of her mouth is likely rounded, but the back jaw ends in a rather sharp point. Her horns are straight and protrude directly from the back of her skull. Her ears are right under her horns and they are best described as thin and long, reaching about half of her horns’ length.
[/p]

[h3]Body[/h3]

[p]
The back of her neck is covered in spines similar to that of a porcupine and if she is healthy then these spines will be sharp and pointed. These spines create a ruff at the back of her head, and continue all the way down her back and to the base of her tail. Flowing from there is her back, which is covered in a traditional scaletype found on other Pyrrhians. Her underbelly is much more leathery and is covered in smaller, softer scales. Her forearms are rather muscular and possess rigid, upturned scales, best described as being the opposite to the scales found on @[SandWing](species:04e1f884-1838-432c-8ea6-e76277b0979f) forearms that are themselves similar to layered platemail. Her hindlegs begin with rather muscular thighs, however her calves and feet are much thinner in comparison. Her front palms and back feet are wide with curled, serrated claws. Her tail is long and thin, ending in razor sharp lashes, similar to that of a whip. Between male and females, the main differences are mostly in muscle definition and volume, with his fore and hindlimbs being thinner.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]

[h3]Wings[/h3]
[p]
Next are her wings and something of importance to note is how her wings do not have a membrane attached to the rest of her body. This hinders gliding and makes flight overall more difficult, but it offers her much greater flexibility and range of movement, allowing for better aeromaneuverability. Another interesting facet of her wings is a distinct claw extending from the wing’s wrist bone.
[/p]
[/col][/row]

[h2]Coloration[/h2]
[p]
Female IceWings have different primary color ranges compared to male IceWings. All IceWings share a secondary and tertiary. All listed locations of where an IceWing's color affects are just the most common locations. Deviations from these locations is only uncommon, rather than impossible. 
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Primary[/h3]
[p]
A female IceWing’s primary color range will typically be pale greens to pale blues as well as near-white red and yellow. A male IceWing’s primary color range will typically be dark blues to pale purples. Both will have their primary color affect their underbellies, shoulders, and wing arms and digits.
[/p]

[h3]Secondary[/h3]
[p]
An IceWing’s secondary color can be any pale and desaturated hue, and will never be the same as their primary. Secondary color usually affects the larger scales found on an IceWing’s back, front forearm scales, and front hindleg scales.
[/p]
[/col]
[col]
[h3]Tertiary[/h3]
[p]
An IceWing’s tertiary color has the same range as their secondary color, and can also be identical to their secondary color. Tertiary color affects the IceWing’s wing membrane, as well as their spines.
[/p]

[h3]Miscellaneous[/h3]
[p]
All IceWings have pearly white talons and horns which slowly turn blue with age. All IceWings have black sclera and black pupils, however the color range of all IceWing irises are identical to that of a male IceWing’s primary range. All IceWings have dark blue blood.
[/p]
[/col][/row]
[p]
[h3]Patternation[/h3]
[p]
All IceWings share a range of common patterns. This range includes geometric shapes on the body and wings; dark freckled scales on the snout, arms, and legs; and even striated, zigzagging marks on the body, arms, and legs. The color of these patterns are typically a quaternary color that is simply a darker variant of the secondary color.
[/p]

[hr]
[h1]Physiology[/h1]
[h2]Perceptions[/h2]
[p]
All IceWings share a set of sensory capabilities. The average IceWing will have an underwhelming tactile sense, being unable to notice small objects that they touch and are touched by, instead only being able to detect being skewered or having scales be pierced. This is doubly true for their icy outerscales, which have no tactile sense whatsoever. Their sense of taste is about the continental average, with IceWings being able to notice most spices within foods, and other bitter, sweet, sour, and savory flavors. Their visual acuity is well above average, second only to the @[SkyWings](species:b1815972-6ede-4bc3-83a4-80b78b78944a) in terms of ability. In addition, IceWings are unaffected by bright lights that would effectively blind any other tribe, including lights created by @[other tribes](species:0cd789c0-7f2e-47f8-b703-55c4cb51f8bb). The average IceWing will also have a highly sensitive sense of smell, and can quickly be overwhelmed in biomes that are not desert or tundra. Lastly, IceWings have an average auditory sense, and can judge source and distance of noise with moderate accuracy.

[h2] Universal Abilities [/h2]
[br]

[row]
[col]
[h3]Frostbreath[/h3]
[p]
Nearly all IceWings possess the unique breath weapon that has been widely regarded as “frostbreath”. Frostbreath, as the name implies, is similar to firebreath with the caveat being that victims are frozen instead of burned. IceWings are able to breathe out freezing vapors in a wide arc in front of themselves. These vapors are able to near-instantly freeze scales and some common metals to the point of immediate fracture. Flesh exposed to a blast of frostbreath will be almost immediately frostbitten and frozen. The average IceWing’s frostbreath can reach temperatures of about one hundred degrees below zero in Celsius. This allows it to make most known materials brittle enough to be snapped with bare talons after only seconds of exposure. Interestingly, frostbreath does not affect other IceWings or @[firescale SkyWings](species:b1815972-6ede-4bc3-83a4-80b78b78944a).	
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h3]Glacial Armor[/h3]
[p]
Almost all IceWings are able to develop a layer of ice over their hard scales. This ability creates a sort of ice shell and acts as the first layer of defense and armor for most IceWings. This ability occurs when the freezing temperature of an IceWing’s body causes the moisture in the air to freeze to their outermost scales. All IceWings will either have this pseudo scale layer or their bodies will passively be trying to create it. Interestingly, the health of an IceWing can be roughly determined by how much water remains unfrozen on their hide, as perspiration often signals overheating rather than regulation. Many factors contribute to the development of this icy armor and how much of it any given IceWing has on themselves. The environment dictates how rapidly this layer will develop, with cold but artificially humid conditions causing record growth of two centimeters per every other day. The individual IceWing dictates how much of this glacial armor actually remains on their body. Managing this ice thickness is a part of many IceWings’ self grooming routine, like spine sharpening or talon clipping. 
[/p]
[/col]
[/row]

[h3]Endogelid Physiology[/h3]
[p]
IceWings have a lower body temperature than any other tribe. Their bodies naturally strive to remain at a subzero temperature and maintain a very cold equilibrium. This aspect is so antithetical and contrary to other tribes that IceWings are often referred to as being “ice blooded” instead of “hot blooded” like every other tribe on Panthia. The mental and physical performance of an IceWing increases as temperature decreases. Not only this but environments even marginally hotter than a temperate autumn forest can have devastating effects on an IceWing. While IceWings are at their strongest in the cold, they become nearly helpless in the heat. Hyperthermia is a well documented issue that many IceWings outside of the Ice Queendom face, and ability degradation begins much earlier. Frostbreath and glacial armor will steadily lose their efficacy outside of the @[Frozen Peninsula](location:a66fafa4-df43-4ffb-b962-6881bcf218f4), the sharpened spines and serrated talons of the average IceWing will begin to dull and melt, and stamina will diminish much faster. 
[/p]

[h2]Limited Abilities[/h2]
[h3]Icestealing[/h3]
[p]
Similarly to the SkyWing tribe's firestealing, “Icestealing” is a phenomenon that occurs in IceWing eggs containing twins. This event leads to one sibling “stealing” the “ice” of their sibling. The exact mechanism by which this anomaly functions is not known, however, the effects are well documented. The sibling who had their ice “stolen” will become a Slushscales, their twin will become an Icescales. 
[/p]

[row]
[col]
[h4]Icescales[/h4]
[p]
Icescales are most known for their freezing internal temperature. They are the coldest dragons on [Panthia], and are regarded as some of the most physically capable within the IceWing tribe. Icescales reap the rewards of their frigidity through a number of benefits. Icescales are able to survive more efficiently in higher temperature conditions, allowing them to live in warmer climates and perform exceptionally in hotter places; they breathe a much colder variant of frostbreath, lowering the time to freeze a target exponentially; and they are able to freeze things within a much greater radius of themselves, increasing the efficacy and endurance of their glacial armor. Icescales tend to be more physically capable than the average IceWing. Some noted drawbacks to this power include immediately freezing objects or entities an icescales comes in contact with and running the risk of becoming entombed in their own glacial armor. In addition, icescales have a significantly higher chance to suffer from debilitating cognitive illnesses, ranging from an early onset of neurodegenerative disease to psychosis-like syndromes. It is unclear whether this is wholly biological in nature and not the result of some societal pressure.
[/p]
[/col]

[col]
[h4]Slushscales[/h4]
[p]
Slushscales derive their name from the effect icestealing has on their body. Slushscales have a much higher internal body temperature while still relying on IceWing physiology. This makes a slushscale’s resting state weaker by default, as their body still functions proportionally to how cold they are. Slushscales tend to grow slower than the average IceWing and are usually unable to develop glacial armor. Their frostbreath is significantly weaker than average and they struggle in all but the coldest climates. Fascinatingly, slushscales appear to be more compassionate than the average dragon. While there is no evidence of the slushscale phenomenon being related to an inherent empathic ability, many claim to be able to feel the more nuanced and primal emotions of those around them.

[h3]Antimus Magic[/h3]
[p]
Similar to the @Animus Magic(law:99a5fca8-712a-43d3-b812-b801b8df1caf) of other tribes, IceWings may be born to possess a very unique and powerful variant of the magical powers. Like animus magic, @[Antimus Magic](law:99a5fca8-712a-43d3-b812-b801b8df1caf) is very complex and is too nuanced of a power to be explained here properly. Essentially, an Antimus dragon is able to perform miracles, but the nature of these miracles are opposite to that of an Animus. Antimus dragons can turn animated creatures or objects into inanimate objects. They can "freeze" things in place, or remove the movement from things. This allows an antimus to do extraordinary things like stop time in an area, remove the heat of a volcano, or just simply extinguish the life in any creature. Unfortunately, this awesome power comes with a great price. Overuse of the power will result in a near instant and violent explosion of frost, freezing the Antimus in place, effectively killing them. Permanent enchantments dissipate with the death of the Antimus caster.

[h1]Ecology[/h1]

[h2]Habitat[/h2]
[p]
Many IceWings enjoy icy, arctic environments. They strive in sub-zero conditions and thus seek out polar tundras and boreal forests. Low temperatures are so sought after that some IceWings live near amphibious lifestyles, living on the northern coasts of the @[Frozen Peninsula](location:a66fafa4-df43-4ffb-b962-6881bcf218f4). In addition, IceWings can tolerate temperate climates with some success. Temperatures below fifteen degrees Celsius is the range in which the average IceWing can, with some long-term adjustment, live comfortably. They can survive in places with temperate seasons with the summer months being the only difficulty. IceWings, barring some of the most resilient icescales, cannot tolerate living in hot or humid climates. As such there are very few, if any, IceWings living in the @[Great Desert](location:fbb17d26-6ac4-4a7f-b3ea-4e9f7a88340f), @Rainforest(location), or coastal regions near the @Glittering Sea(location) and @Bay of a Thousand Scales(location). IceWings tend to build homes using ice-bricks made with their breath weapon or by claiming a cavern of proper size. IceWings are very family oriented and often live with immediate and extended family in communities made up of other in-law families. 
[/p]

[h2]Diet[/h2]
[p]
All IceWings are mostly carnivorous. They eat large game animals like reindeer and caribou, eat coldwater fish such as salmon and cod, and eat smaller animals such as arctic fox and rabbit. Most IceWings consider this an ideal diet with the only addition being small amounts of sweet-tasting fruits and berries that do not provide many dietary benefits. Typically, they will eat their catch raw or, on special occasions, cooked and subsequently frozen. During times of desperation, IceWings are able to sustain an omnivorous diet for extended periods while only risking an increase in afflictions such as malnutrition and various other diseases. IceWings cannot eat any sort of carrion, nor survive on a strictly herbivorous diet. Despite this, they take rather well to herbal remedies, with chilled tinctures being a popular form of illness treatment. This fact relies on proper preparation and adequate chilling. Most IceWings eat about two meals per day and will starve at a below average rate. Severe symptoms of starvation manifest after about two weeks. Total starvation, almost always resulting in death, occurs after three weeks and three days. Conversely, IceWings dehydrate at a slightly above average rate. Symptoms of severe dehydration manifest after only two days, and death is nearly certain after only five. Environmental variables can factor into this, either reducing or increasing the rate of dehydration in either perfectly cold or unbearably hot conditions respectively. IceWings are ambush and endurance hunters, setting traps or running down potential prey. When able, IceWings utilize fisheries and a form of ranching to sustain themselves.
[/p]

[h2]Reproduction[/h2]
[p]
IceWings are an oviparous tribe that reproduces sexually. A female and male will mate and produce offspring. Typically, this will result in a clutch of three eggs laid by the mother. Each egg takes about twenty-four hours to form. IceWings use a variety of methods to try and ensure that eggs are properly chilled. This can include burying eggs in snow, placing them inside of igloos, or even, in some circumstances, freezing them using frostbreath. There is no set standard, however, communities will often have traditions that vary between each other. Whatever the nesting method, nests are often near the home of the parents or in communal, specially curated structures. Contrary to all other tribes, IceWing eggs require subzero conditions in order to properly develop. These eggs will then develop for twelve lunar cycles before hatching. IceWing eggs are oblong in shape, pearly white with a blue pearlescent, and smooth to the touch. Eggs wherein icestealing occurs do not have an alternate appearance, save for being markedly larger than single dragonet eggs. 
[/p]

[h2]Lifecycle[/h2]
[p]
IceWings are born precocial with immediate access to their perceptions. Fully developed IceWings will breach through their egg, first using an eggtooth at the tip of their snout and then using their newly acquired claws to tear themselves free. Once the hatchling exits their egg they will begin to vocalize at a high pitch and frequency in an attempt to call upon a parent or guardian. This will persist until the hatchling is retrieved. It takes two days for a baby IceWing to ambulate proficiently and it takes eleven days for a baby IceWing to begin to fly. Furthermore, the universal abilities of a baby IceWing will take about ten days to manifest. Icescales and slushscales will have their abilities manifest pre-hatching. Adolescence begins at about one lunar year for most IceWings and is marked by the initial development of all abilities and perceptions. These abilities and perceptions also will grow proportionally with age before plateauing at adulthood. Adulthood is reached at seven lunar years of age. IceWings suffer from senescence and therefore have a maximum age of one-hundred fifty years. Despite this, the average IceWing’s life span is only ninety years.

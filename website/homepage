[h2]Introduction[/h2]
[p]
This alternate universe (AU) is a collection of fanfiction created to add further depth and nuance to Tui's world. Some of the major goals of this project include:
[left][ol]
[li]Building a canon-friendly alternate setting[/li]
[li]Adding commonly accepted headcanons in an organized manner[/li]
[li]Adding foundational lore left unanswered by the main series [/li]
[li]Being roleplay-friendly[/li]
[/ol][/left]
[/p]

[h2]Shared Fanfiction[/h2]
[p]
Finally, this project is [b]entirely free to use[/b] in any way permitted by Scholastic and Tui T. Sutherland. All of the articles, characters, and other content of this project are completely open for fans to modify, use, or customize to fit their own fanfictions and spin-off worlds. While PYRE does not own Wings of Fire, there should be no fear of social stigmatization for other fans looking to use PYRE in their own fan projects.

There is no need to ask for permission from me or any other collaborators to take what is in this world.

Go out there, have fun. Make Cool Things.
